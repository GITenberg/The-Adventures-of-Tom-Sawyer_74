version notes:

Mark Twain (real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens) (1835-1910) is probably one of the most known American writers. He was immensely popular in his time, especially noted for his wit and humour, and he is still widely quoted nowadays.

Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn are probably the best known characters of Mark Twain, and "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" (1876) is the first book where they appear. Here we read about the games Tom plays with his friends and schoolmates, as pirates, Robin Hood, etc., his flirtations with Becky Thatcher, his search for a hidden treasure, his troubles with "Injun Joe"...

This version includes the illustrations of the first edition, by True Williams (I wish I could have used Norman Rockwell's, maybe in 2029), and is proofread (or "smoothread"), which was not easy, because the txt and html versions in PG have different text, and both are different from the 1st edition scans, which is itself inconsistent... Oh, and it is the uncensored text, so don't complain if you find some n-words.

From the technical point of view, the chapter titles use illustrations with text wrap around them. If this is not desired (or does not work for a given reader), it can be disabled by commenting/uncommenting the top lines in OEBPS/css/style.css. In Chapter V there is a small fragment of SVG which may not look fine in some readers, the normal XHTML code is commented out in OEBPS/Chapter-05.xhtml, if it's desired. In Chapter X there is a piece of handwriting as an illustration, the text is also commented out in OEBPS/Chapter-10.xhtml, if needed.

All feedback is welcome.

EDIT (v2): Fixed typo in TOC
