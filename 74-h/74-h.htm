<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br />
<p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred;
one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who
were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer
also, but not from an individual&mdash;he is a combination of the
characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to
the composite order of architecture.</p>
<p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among
children and slaves in the West at the period of this
story&mdash;that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of
boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on
that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly
remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they
felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they
sometimes engaged in.</p>

<p>"TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"What's gone with that boy, &nbsp;I wonder? You TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them
about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She
seldom or never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy;
they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built
for "style," not service&mdash;she could have seen through a pair
of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and
then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to
hear:</p>
<p>"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and
punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to
punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the
cat.</p>
<p>"I never did see the beat of that boy!"</p>
<p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among
the tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden.
No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for
distance and shouted:</p>
<p>"Y-o-u-u TOM!"</p>
<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time
to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his
flight.</p>
<p>"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing
in there?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS
that truck?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, aunt."</p>
<p>"Well, I know. It's jam&mdash;that's what it is. Forty times
I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me
that switch."</p>
<p>The switch hovered in the air&mdash;the peril was
desperate&mdash;</p>
<p>"My! Look behind you, aunt!"</p>
<p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of
danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high
board-fence, and disappeared over it.</p>
<br />

<p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a
gentle laugh.</p>
<p>"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me
tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this
time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an
old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never
plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's
coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I
get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for
a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him
a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's
truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the
Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I
know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead
sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,
and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man
that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the
Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this
evening, * and [* Southwestern for "afternoon"] I'll just be
obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty
hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having
holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and
I've GOT to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of
the child."</p>
<p>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back
home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw
next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper&mdash;at
least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim
did three-fourths of the work. Tom's younger brother (or rather
half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work
(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous,
trouble-some ways.</p>

<p>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as
opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full
of guile, and very deep&mdash;for she wanted to trap him into
damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was
her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark
and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most
transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:</p>
<p>"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"Powerful warm, warn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"</p>
<p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom&mdash;a touch of uncomfortable
suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing.
So he said:</p>
<p>"No'm&mdash;well, not very much."</p>
<p>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and
said:</p>
<p>"But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to
reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without
anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in
spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled
what might be the next move:</p>
<p>"Some of us pumped on our heads&mdash;mine's damp yet. See?"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:</p>
<p>"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed
it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"</p>
<p>The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket.
His shirt collar was securely sewed.</p>
<p>"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played
hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're
a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is&mdash;better'n you look.
THIS time."</p>
<p>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad
that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.</p>
<p>But Sidney said:</p>
<p>"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white
thread, but it's black."</p>
<p>"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"</p>
<p>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he
said:</p>
<p>"Siddy, I'll lick you for that."</p>
<p>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust
into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about
them&mdash;one needle carried white thread and the other black. He
said:</p>
<p>"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it!
sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with
black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other&mdash;I
can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that.
I'll learn him!"</p>
<p>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy
very well though&mdash;and loathed him.</p>
<p>Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his
troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and
bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and
powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for
the time&mdash;just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the
excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued
novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and
he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in a
peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by
touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in
the midst of the music&mdash;the reader probably remembers how to
do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave
him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth
full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an
astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet&mdash;no doubt, as
far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage
was with the boy, not the astronomer.</p>
<p>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently
Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him&mdash;a boy a
shade larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was
an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St.
Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too&mdash;well dressed on a
week-day. This was simply as- tounding. His cap was a dainty thing,
his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so
were his pantaloons. He had shoes on&mdash;and it was only Friday.
He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified
air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at
the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery
and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow.
Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved&mdash;but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all
the time. Finally Tom said:</p>
<p>"I can lick you!"</p>
<p>"I'd like to see you try it."</p>
<p>"Well, I can do it."</p>
<p>"No you can't, either."</p>
<p>"Yes I can."</p>
<p>"No you can't."</p>
<p>"I can."</p>
<p>"You can't."</p>
<p>"Can!"</p>
<p>"Can't!"</p>
<p>An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."</p>
<p>"Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you?"</p>
<p>"If you say much, I will."</p>
<p>"Much&mdash;much&mdash;MUCH. There now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick you
with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it."</p>
<p>"Well I WILL, if you fool with me."</p>
<p>"Oh yes&mdash;I've seen whole families in the same fix."</p>
<p>"Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a
hat!"</p>
<p>"You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock
it off&mdash;and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs."</p>
<p>"You're a liar!"</p>
<p>"You're another."</p>
<p>"You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."</p>
<p>"Aw&mdash;take a walk!"</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and
bounce a rock off'n your head."</p>
<p>"Oh, of COURSE you will."</p>
<p>"Well I WILL."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will
for? Why don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid."</p>
<p>"I AIN'T afraid."</p>
<p>"You are."</p>
<p>"I ain't."</p>
<p>"You are."</p>

<br />
<p>Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other.
Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Get away from here!"</p>
<p>"Go away yourself!"</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"I won't either."</p>
<p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace,
and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other
with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling
till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with
watchful caution, and Tom said:</p>
<p>"You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and
he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it,
too."</p>
<p>"What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's
bigger than he is&mdash;and what's more, he can throw him over that
fence, too." [Both brothers were imaginary.]</p>
<p>"That's a lie."</p>
<p>"YOUR saying so don't make it so."</p>
<p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:</p>
<p>"I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't
stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep."</p>
<p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:</p>
<p>"Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."</p>
<p>"Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."</p>
<p>"Well, you SAID you'd do it&mdash;why don't you do it?"</p>
<p>"By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it."</p>
<p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held
them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an
instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped
together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and
tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each
other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently
the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom
appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his
fists. "Holler 'nuff!" said he.</p>
<p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was
crying&mdash;mainly from rage.</p>
<p>"Holler 'nuff!"&mdash;and the pounding went on.</p>
<p>At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let
him up and said:</p>
<p>"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with
next time."</p>
<p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,
sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his
head and threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he
caught him out." To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off
in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy
snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and
then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor
home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at
the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the
enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At
last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious,
vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he
"'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.</p>

<p>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed
cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the
person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in
her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard
labor became adamantine in its firmness.</p>

<p>SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright
and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart;
and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was
cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees
were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.
Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with
vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable
Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p>
<p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left
him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty
yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and
existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it
along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;
compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching
continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box
discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and
singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always
been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike
him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White,
mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their
turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a
hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of
water under an hour&mdash;and even then somebody generally had to
go after him. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."</p>
<p>Jim shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git
dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec'
Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long
an' 'tend to my own business&mdash;she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de
whitewashin'."</p>
<p>"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she
always talks. Gimme the bucket&mdash;I won't be gone only a a
minute. SHE won't ever know."</p>
<p>"Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head
off'n me. 'Deed she would."</p>
<p>"SHE! She never licks anybody&mdash;whacks 'em over the head
with her thimble&mdash;and who cares for that, I'd like to know.
She talks awful, but talk don't hurt&mdash;anyways it don't if she
don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white
alley!"</p>
<p>Jim began to waver.</p>
<p>"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."</p>
<p>"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's
powerful 'fraid ole missis&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."</p>
<p>Jim was only human&mdash;this attraction was too much for him.
He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe
with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In
another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a
tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was
retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in
her eye.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he
had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free
boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious
expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having
to work&mdash;the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got
out his worldly wealth and examined it&mdash;bits of toys, marbles,
and trash; enough to buy an exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half
enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he
returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea
of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an
inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent
inspiration.</p>
<p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers
hove in sight presently&mdash;the very boy, of all boys, whose
ridicule he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the
hop-skip-and-jump&mdash;proof enough that his heart was light and
his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long,
melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat.
As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street,
leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with
laborious pomp and circumstance&mdash;for he was personating the
Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of
water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had
to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the
orders and executing them:</p>
<p>"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out,
and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and
stiffened down his sides.</p>
<p>"Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow!
ch-chow-wow! Chow!" His right hand, mean-time, describing stately
circles&mdash;for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.</p>
<p>"Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling!
Chow-ch-chow-chow!" The left hand began to describe circles.</p>
<p>"Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come
ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
Ting-a-ling- ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! LIVELY now!
Come&mdash;out with your spring-line&mdash;what're you about there!
Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that
stage, now&mdash;let her go! Done with the engines, sir!
Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!" (trying the gauge-cocks).</p>
<p>Tom went on whitewashing&mdash;paid no attention to the
steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: "Hi-YI! YOU'RE up a
stump, ain't you!"</p>
<p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an
artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed
the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth
watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:</p>
<p>"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"</p>
<p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p>
<p>"Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing."</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you
could? But of course you'd druther WORK&mdash;wouldn't you? Course
you would!"</p>
<p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p>
<p>"What do you call work?"</p>
<p>"Why, ain't THAT work?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img030" id="img030"></a><br />

<img alt="02-030.jpg (170K)" src="images/02-030.jpg" height="1024"
width="787" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</p>
<p>"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits
Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?"</p>
<p>The brush continued to move.</p>
<p>"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a
boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"</p>
<p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his
apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth&mdash;stepped
back to note the effect&mdash;added a touch here and
there&mdash;criticised the effect again&mdash;Ben watching every
move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.
Presently he said:</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little."</p>
<p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his
mind:</p>
<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see,
Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence&mdash;right here on
the street, you know&mdash;but if it was the back fence I wouldn't
mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this
fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one
boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's
got to be done."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;is that so? Oh come, now&mdash;lemme just try. Only
just a little&mdash;I'd let YOU, if you was me, Tom."</p>
<p>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly&mdash;well, Jim
wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and
she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was
to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try.
Say&mdash;I'll give you the core of my apple."</p>
<p>"Well, here&mdash;No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll give you ALL of it!"</p>
<p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity
in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and
sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade
close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the
slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys
happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained
to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the
next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he
played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to
swing it with&mdash;and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when
the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor
poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles,
part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through,
a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of
chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of
tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass
door-knob, a dog-collar&mdash;but no dog&mdash;the handle of a
knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window
sash.</p>

width="510" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while&mdash;plenty of
company&mdash;and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If
he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy
in the village.</p>
<p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after
all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing
it&mdash;namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a
thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.
If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of
this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of
whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of
whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to
understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a
tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc
is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive
four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily
line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would
turn it into work and then they would resign.</p>
<p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken
place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward
headquarters to report.</p>

<br />
<p>TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy
summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the
drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was
nodding over her knitting&mdash;for she had no company but the cat,
and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her
gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had
deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in
her power again in this intrepid way. He said: "Mayn't I go and
play now, aunt?"</p>
<p>"What, a'ready? How much have you done?"</p>
<p>"It's all done, aunt."</p>
<p>"Tom, don't lie to me&mdash;I can't bear it."</p>
<p>"I ain't, aunt; it IS all done."</p>
<p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to
see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per
cent. of Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence
white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and
recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment
was almost unspeakable. She said:</p>
<p>"Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when
you're a mind to, Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by
adding, "But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to
say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back some time in a
week, or I'll tan you."</p>
<p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she
took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered
it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and
flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through
virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural
flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut.</p>
<p>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside
stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were
handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged
around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect
her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods
had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone.
There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for
time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had
settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and
getting him into trouble.</p>

<p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that
led by the back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely
beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the
public square of the village, where two "military" companies of
boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom
was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend)
General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend
to fight in person&mdash;that being better suited to the still
smaller fry&mdash;but sat together on an eminence and conducted the
field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's
army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then
the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next
disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle
appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away,
and Tom turned homeward alone.</p>

<p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw
a new girl in the garden&mdash;a lovely little blue-eyed creature
with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock
and embroidered pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without
firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and
left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved
her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and
behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been
months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had
been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven
short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his
heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.</p>
<p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that
she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was
present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish
ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque
foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst
of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw
that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came
up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would
tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then
moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot
on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a
pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.</p>
<br />

width="325" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the
flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look
down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on
in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying
to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he
moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer
toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant
toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and
disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute&mdash;only
while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his
heart&mdash;or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much
posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</p>
<p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall,
"showing off," as before; but the girl never exhibited herself
again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she
had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his
attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head
full of visions.</p>
<p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt
wondered "what had got into the child." He took a good scolding
about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He
tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got his
knuckles rapped for it. He said:</p>
<p>"Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."</p>
<p>"Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always
into that sugar if I warn't watching you."</p>
<p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his
immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl&mdash;a sort of glorying over
Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and
the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies
that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to
himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in,
but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;
and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the
world as to see that pet model "catch it." He was so brimful of
exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came
back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from
over her spectacles. He said to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was
uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:</p>
<p>"Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for?&mdash;Sid broke
it!"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity.
But when she got her tongue again, she only said:</p>
<p>"Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into
some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like
enough."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say
something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be
construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and
discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her
affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted
his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to
him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He
would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew
that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film
of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself
lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one
little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he
pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls
all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself
upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray
God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him
any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no
sign&mdash;a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He
so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that
he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes
swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran
down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have
any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it
was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin
Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after
an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved
in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and
sunshine in at the other.</p>

<p>He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought
desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in
the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and
contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while,
that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously,
without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.
Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted,
and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she
would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a
right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him? Or would she
turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture brought
such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and
over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till
he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in
the darkness.</p>

<br />
<p>About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted
street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no
sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow
upon the curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence
there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the
plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long,
and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it,
disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his
breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would
die&mdash;out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless
head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no
loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came.
And thus SHE would see him when she looked out upon the glad
morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor,
lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright
young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?</p>
<p>The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned
the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's
remains!</p>

<p>The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was
a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a
curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague
form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.</p>
<p>Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if
he had any dim idea of making any "references to allusions," he
thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in
Tom's eye.</p>
<p>Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid
made mental note of the omission.</p>

<p>THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the
peaceful village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had
family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of
solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin
mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a
grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.</p>
<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to
"get his verses." Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent
all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose
part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses
that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague
general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was
traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were
busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him
recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:</p>
<p>"Blessed are the&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Poor"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;poor; blessed are the
poor&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In spirit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for
they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"THEIRS&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for
they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sh&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For they&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"S, H, A&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For they S, H&mdash;Oh, I don't know what it is!"</p>
<p>"SHALL!"</p>
<p>"Oh, SHALL! for they shall&mdash;for they
shall&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;shall
mourn&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;blessed are they that shall&mdash;they
that&mdash;a&mdash;they that shall mourn, for they
shall&mdash;a&mdash;shall WHAT? Why don't you tell me,
Mary?&mdash;what do you want to be so mean for?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I
wouldn't do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be
discouraged, Tom, you'll manage it&mdash;and if you do, I'll give
you something ever so nice. There, now, that's a good boy."</p>
<p>"All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is."</p>
<p>"Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is
nice."</p>
<p>"You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it
again."</p>
<p>And he did "tackle it again"&mdash;and under the double pressure
of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that
he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new
"Barlow" knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of
delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True,
the knife would not cut anything, but it was a "sure-enough"
Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that&mdash;though
where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could
possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and
will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he
was called off to dress for Sunday-school.</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he
went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there;
then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up
his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then
entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the
towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said:</p>
<p>"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't
hurt you."</p>
<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this
time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in
a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with
both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an
honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face.
But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,
for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws,
like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of
unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around
his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he
was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his
saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into
a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out
the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close
down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own
filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two
years&mdash;they were simply called his "other clothes"&mdash;and
so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl "put him to
rights" after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat
roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over
his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled
straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He
was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint
about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that
Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated
them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them
out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>
<p>"Please, Tom&mdash;that's a good boy."</p>
<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the
three children set out for Sunday-school&mdash;a place that Tom
hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then
church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon
voluntarily, and the other always remained too&mdash;for stronger
reasons. The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat
about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain
affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a
steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a
Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>
<p>"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What'll you take for her?"</p>
<p>"What'll you give?"</p>
<p>"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook."</p>
<p>"Less see 'em."</p>
<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed
hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red
tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.
He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of
various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the
church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls,
proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that
came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then
turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next
bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around;
stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say
"Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole class
were of a pattern&mdash;restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they
came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses
perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried
through, and each got his reward&mdash;in small blue tickets, each
with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two
verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and
could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one;
for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound
Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How
many of my readers would have the industry and application to
memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary
had acquired two Bibles in this way&mdash;it was the patient work
of two years&mdash;and a boy of German parentage had won four or
five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but
the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was
little better than an idiot from that day forth&mdash;a grievous
misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company,
the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy
come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to
keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to
get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare
and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and
conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was
fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It
is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for
one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for
many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with
it.</p>

<br />
<p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the
pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger
inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a
Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a
hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of
music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform
and sings a solo at a concert&mdash;though why, is a mystery: for
neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by
the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of
thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a
stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and
whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
mouth&mdash;a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a
turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin
was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as
a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned
sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners&mdash;an
effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by
sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together.
Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest
at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence,
and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to
himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation
which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:</p>
<p>"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and
pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or
two. There&mdash;that is it. That is the way good little boys and
girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the
window&mdash;I am afraid she thinks I am out there
somewhere&mdash;perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to
the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good
it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces
assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good."
And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of
the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is
familiar to us all.</p>
<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of
fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by
fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even
to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.
But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr.
Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with
a burst of silent gratitude.</p>
<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event
which was more or less rare&mdash;the entrance of visitors: lawyer
Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine,
portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified
lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was leading a
child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings;
conscience-smitten, too&mdash;he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye,
he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small
newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next
moment he was "showing off" with all his might&mdash;cuffing boys,
pulling hair, making faces&mdash;in a word, using every art that
seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His
exaltation had but one alloy&mdash;the memory of his humiliation in
this angel's garden&mdash;and that record in sand was fast washing
out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it
now.</p>
<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon
as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the
school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious
personage&mdash;no less a one than the county
judge&mdash;altogether the most august creation these children had
ever looked upon&mdash;and they wondered what kind of material he
was made of&mdash;and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were
half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles
away&mdash;so he had travelled, and seen the world&mdash;these very
eyes had looked upon the county court-house&mdash;which was said to
have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was
attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes.
This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer.
Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the
great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to
his soul to hear the whisperings:</p>
<p>"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say&mdash;look! he's a
going to shake hands with him&mdash;he IS shaking hands with him!
By jings, don't you wish you was Jeff?"</p>
<p>Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a
target. The librarian "showed off"&mdash;running hither and thither
with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and
fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers
"showed off"&mdash;bending sweetly over pupils that were lately
being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and
patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed
off" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority
and fine attention to discipline&mdash;and most of the teachers, of
both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it
was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three
times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls "showed off"
in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such
diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of
scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a
majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in
the sun of his own grandeur&mdash;for he was "showing off,"
too.</p>
<p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy
complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and
exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but
none had enough&mdash;he had been around among the star pupils
inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad
back again with a sound mind.</p>
<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came
forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue
ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear
sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for
the next ten years. But there was no getting around it&mdash;here
were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom
was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other
elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was
the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the
sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's
altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of
one. The boys were all eaten up with envy&mdash;but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that
they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading
tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling
whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the
dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.</p>
<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught
him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the
light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had
warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his
premises&mdash;a dozen would strain his capacity, without a
doubt.</p>
<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see
it in her face&mdash;but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she
was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and
went&mdash;came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her
worlds&mdash;and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and
angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all
(she thought).</p>
<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his
breath would hardly come, his heart quaked&mdash;partly because of
the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her
parent. He would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it
were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called
him a fine little man, and asked him what his name was. The boy
stammered, gasped, and got it out:</p>
<p>"Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, not Tom&mdash;it is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thomas."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's
very well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to
me, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas," said Walters, "and
say sir. You mustn't forget your manners."</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer&mdash;sir."</p>

<p>"That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little
fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many&mdash;very, very great
many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn
them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the
world; it's what makes great men and good men; you'll be a great
man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look
back and say, It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school
privileges of my boyhood&mdash;it's all owing to my dear teachers
that taught me to learn&mdash;it's all owing to the good
superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me
a beautiful Bible&mdash;a splendid elegant Bible&mdash;to keep and
have it all for my own, always&mdash;it's all owing to right
bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas&mdash;and you
wouldn't take any money for those two thousand verses&mdash;no
indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and this
lady some of the things you've learned&mdash;no, I know you
wouldn't&mdash;for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no
doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't you
tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?"</p>
<p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He
blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within
him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer
the simplest question&mdash;why DID the Judge ask him? Yet he felt
obliged to speak up and say:</p>
<p>"Answer the gentleman, Thomas&mdash;don't be afraid."</p>
<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>
<p>"Now I know you'll tell me," said the lady. "The names of the
first two disciples were&mdash;"</p>
<p>"DAVID AND GOLIAH!"</p>
<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the
scene.</p>

<p>ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began
to ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning
sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the
house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under
supervision. Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with
her&mdash;Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might
be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside
summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged
and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his
wife&mdash;for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries;
the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and
forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and
much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St.
Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward;
lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of
the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked
young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a
body&mdash;for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their
cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till
the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model
Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if
she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
good. And besides, he had been "thrown up to them" so much. His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual
on Sundays&mdash;accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he
looked upon boys who had as snobs.</p>

<br />
<p>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once
more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell
upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and
whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered
and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir
that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It
was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything
about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.</p>
<p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a
relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of
the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily
up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong
emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a
spring-board:</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img055" id="img055"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="05-055.jpg (94K)" src="images/05-055.jpg" height="558"

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of ease,</p>
<p>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOOD-y
seas?</p>
<p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables" he
was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the
ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in
their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much
as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO
beautiful for this mortal earth."</p>
<p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned
himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings
and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch
out to the crack of doom&mdash;a queer custom which is still kept
up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant
newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional
custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>
<p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and
went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little
children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for
the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State
officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United
States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the
Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the
oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies
and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good
tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for
the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a
supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time
a grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p>
<p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation
sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the
prayer, he only endured it&mdash;if he even did that much. He was
restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer,
unconsciously&mdash;for he was not listening, but he knew the
ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it&mdash;and
when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear
detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly
had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his
spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head
with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to
almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck
was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and
smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going
through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was
perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands
itched to grab for it they did not dare&mdash;he believed his soul
would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the
prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began
to curve and steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out the
fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him
let it go.</p>
<p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously
through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by
began to nod&mdash;and yet it was an argument that dealt in
limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down
to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom counted
the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages
there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the
discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a little
while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the
lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child
should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the
great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that
he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.</p>

width="359" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was
resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it
out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws&mdash;a
"pinchbug," he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first
thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural
fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit
on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The
beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over.
Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach.
Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle,
and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling
along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,
weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked
around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it
again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip
and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another,
and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach
with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments;
grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His
head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched
the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the
poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit
on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a
gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too,
and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a
wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a
circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature,
making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his
head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more,
after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no
relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor,
and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle
entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and
so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up
the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till
presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the
gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered
from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out
of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and
died in the distance.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting,
all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the
gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered
burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if
the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine
relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the
benediction pronounced.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that
there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a
bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was
willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not
think it was upright in him to carry it off.</p>

<p>MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always
found him so&mdash;because it began another week's slow suffering
in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no
intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters
again so much more odious.</p>
<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he
was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague
possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he
investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky
symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope.
But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He
reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his
upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin
to groan, as a "starter," as he called it, when it occurred to him
that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull
it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth
in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for
some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell
about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks
and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew
his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with
considerable spirit.</p>
<p>But Sid slept on unconscious.</p>
<p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in
the toe.</p>
<p>No result from Sid.</p>
<p>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest
and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable
groans.</p>
<p>Sid snored on.</p>
<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, "Sid, Sid!" and shook him. This
course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned,
stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and
began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p>
<p>"Tom! Say, Tom!" [No response.] "Here, Tom! TOM! What is the
matter, Tom?" And he shook him and looked in his face
anxiously.</p>
<p>Tom moaned out:</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me."</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call
anybody."</p>
<p>"But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been
this way?"</p>
<p>"Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me."</p>
<p>"Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my
flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever
done to me. When I'm gone&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom&mdash;oh, don't.
Maybe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid,
you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl
that's come to town, and tell her&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in
reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his
groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.</p>
<p>Sid flew downstairs and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!"</p>
<p>"Dying!"</p>
<p>"Yes'm. Don't wait&mdash;come quick!"</p>
<p>"Rubbage! I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her
heels. And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she
reached the bedside she gasped out:</p>
<p>"You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, auntie, I'm&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you&mdash;what is the matter with you,
child?"</p>
<p>"Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!"</p>
<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then
cried a little, then did both together. This restored her and she
said:</p>
<p>"Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense
and climb out of this."</p>
<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy
felt a little foolish, and he said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded
my tooth at all."</p>
<p>"Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?"</p>
<p>"One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful."</p>
<p>"There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your
mouth. Well&mdash;your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die
about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of
the kitchen."</p>
<p>Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more.
I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't
want to stay home from school."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you
thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom,
Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break
my old heart with your outrageousness." By this time the dental
instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk
thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the
bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it
almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,
now.</p>
<p>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to
school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because
the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a
new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads
interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and
had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now
found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.
His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not
feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another
boy said, "Sour grapes!" and he wandered away a dismantled
hero.</p>
<p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village,
Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was
cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because
he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad&mdash;and because all
their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden
society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the
rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his
gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play
with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of
full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering
with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out
of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels
and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender
supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and
contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not
rolled up.</p>

width="341" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on
doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not
have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey
anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose,
and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he
could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy
that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in
the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could
swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life
precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered,
respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>
<p>"Hello, Huckleberry!"</p>
<p>"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."</p>
<p>"What's that you got?"</p>
<p>"Dead cat."</p>
<p>"Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get
him?"</p>
<p>"Bought him off'n a boy."</p>
<p>"What did you give?"</p>
<p>"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the
slaughter-house."</p>
<p>"Where'd you get the blue ticket?"</p>
<p>"Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick."</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;what is dead cats good for, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Good for? Cure warts with."</p>
<p>"No! Is that so? I know something that's better."</p>
<p>"I bet you don't. What is it?"</p>
<p>"Why, spunk-water."</p>
<p>"Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?"</p>
<p>"No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did."</p>
<p>"Who told you so!"</p>
<p>"Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and
Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a
nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!"</p>
<p>"Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the
nigger. I don't know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN'T
lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck."</p>
<p>"Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
rain-water was."</p>
<p>"In the daytime?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"With his face to the stump?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Least I reckon so."</p>
<p>"Did he say anything?"</p>
<p>"I don't reckon he did. I don't know."</p>
<p>"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a
blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You
got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you
know there's a spunk- water stump, and just as it's midnight you
back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:</p>
<p>'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water,
spunk-water, swaller these warts,'</p>
<p>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and
then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to
anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted."</p>
<p>"Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob
Tanner done."</p>
<p>"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in
this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to
work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands
that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got
considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean."</p>
<p>"Yes, bean's good. I've done that."</p>
<p>"Have you? What's your way?"</p>
<p>"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some
blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take
and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the
dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You
see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and
drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps
the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it, Huck&mdash;that's it; though when you're
burying it if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother
me!' it's better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been
nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say&mdash;how do you
cure 'em with dead cats?"</p>
<p>"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long
about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and
when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but
you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or
maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you
heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow
devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch ANY
wart."</p>
<p>"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me."</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a
witch."</p>
<p>"Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his
own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him,
so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her.
Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin
drunk, and broke his arm."</p>
<p>"Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?"</p>
<p>"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at
you right stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble.
Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer
backards."</p>

<p>"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?"</p>
<p>"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams
to-night."</p>
<p>"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday
night?"</p>
<p>"Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till
midnight?&mdash;and THEN it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around
much of a Sunday, I don't reckon."</p>
<p>"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"</p>
<p>"Of course&mdash;if you ain't afeard."</p>
<p>"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time,
you kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks
at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his
window&mdash;but don't you tell."</p>
<p>"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching
me, but I'll meow this time. Say&mdash;what's that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but a tick."</p>
<p>"Where'd you get him?"</p>
<p>"Out in the woods."</p>
<p>"What'll you take for him?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I don't want to sell him."</p>
<p>"All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway."</p>
<p>"Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm
satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me."</p>
<p>"Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if
I wanted to."</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This
is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this
year."</p>
<p>"Say, Huck&mdash;I'll give you my tooth for him."</p>
<p>"Less see it."</p>
<p>Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.
Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At
last he said:</p>
<p>"Is it genuwyne?"</p>
<p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p>
<p>"Well, all right," said Huckleberry, "it's a trade."</p>
<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately
been the pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling
wealthier than before.</p>
<p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he
strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all
honest speed. He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his
seat with business-like alacrity. The master, throned on high in
his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy
hum of study. The interruption roused him.</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer!"</p>
<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant
trouble.</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>"Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?"</p>
<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long
tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the
electric sympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT
PLACE on the girls' side of the school-house. He instantly
said:</p>
<p>"I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!"</p>
<p>The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The
buzz of study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had
lost his mind. The master said:</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you did what?"</p>
<p>"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have
ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take
off your jacket."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of
switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:</p>
<p>"Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning
to you."</p>
<p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the
boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his
worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay
in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine
bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her
head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat
still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed
to study his book.</p>
<p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school
murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to
steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, "made a mouth"
at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.
When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She
thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again,
but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place.
Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, "Please take
it&mdash;I got more." The girl glanced at the words, but made no
sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his
work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but
her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly
perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The
girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did
not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and
hesitatingly whispered:</p>
<p>"Let me see it."</p>

<br />
<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two
gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney.
Then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and
she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a
moment, then whispered:</p>
<p>"It's nice&mdash;make a man."</p>
<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a
derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not
hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and
whispered:</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful man&mdash;now make me coming along."</p>
<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it
and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl
said:</p>
<p>"It's ever so nice&mdash;I wish I could draw."</p>
<p>"It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you."</p>
<p>"Oh, will you? When?"</p>
<p>"At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"</p>
<p>"I'll stay if you will."</p>
<p>"Good&mdash;that's a whack. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas
Sawyer."</p>
<p>"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You
call me Tom, will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words
from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to
see. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh, it ain't anything."</p>
<p>"Yes it is."</p>
<p>"No it ain't. You don't want to see."</p>
<p>"Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me."</p>
<p>"You'll tell."</p>
<p>"No I won't&mdash;deed and deed and double deed won't."</p>
<p>"You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?"</p>
<p>"No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me."</p>
<p>"Oh, YOU don't want to see!"</p>
<p>"Now that you treat me so, I WILL see." And she put her small
hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist
in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words
were revealed: "I LOVE YOU."</p>
<p>"Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but
reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing
on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne
across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering
fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over
him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his
throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his
heart was jubilant.</p>

<p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study,
but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place
in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography
class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and
rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the
spelling class, and got "turned down," by a succession of mere baby
words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter
medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.</p>

<p>THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more
his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it
up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air
was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the
sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and
twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in
the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill
lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,
tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy
wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some
cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else
to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His
hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then
furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and
put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a
gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was
premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned
him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.</p>
<p>Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been,
and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this
entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The
two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on
Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in
exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon
Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither
getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on
the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to
bottom.</p>
<p>"Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir him
up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on
my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from
crossing over."</p>
<p>"All right, go ahead; start him up."</p>
<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.
Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back
again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was
worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on
with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the
slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck
seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and
the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys
themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his
very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to
begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At
last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong.
So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a
moment. Said he:</p>
<p>"Tom, you let him alone."</p>
<p>"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe."</p>
<p>"No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone."</p>
<p>"Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much."</p>
<p>"Let him alone, I tell you."</p>
<p>"I won't!"</p>
<p>"You shall&mdash;he's on my side of the line."</p>
<p>"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?"</p>
<p>"I don't care whose tick he is&mdash;he's on my side of the
line, and you sha'n't touch him."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do
what I blame please with him, or die!"</p>
<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its
duplicate on Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust
continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy
it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had
stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing
down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a good part
of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to
it.</p>
<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and
whispered in her ear:</p>
<p>"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you
get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down
through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it
over 'em the same way."</p>
<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other
with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the
lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to
themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and
Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and
so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began
to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He
said:</p>
<p>"Do you love rats?"</p>
<p>"No! I hate them!"</p>
<p>"Well, I do, too&mdash;LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing
round your head with a string."</p>
<p>"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is
chewing-gum."</p>
<p>"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now."</p>
<p>"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you
must give it back to me."</p>
<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled
their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.</p>
<p>"Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.</p>
<p>"Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm
good."</p>
<p>"I been to the circus three or four times&mdash;lots of times.
Church ain't shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a
circus all the time. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I
grow up."</p>
<p>"Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted
up."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money&mdash;most a
dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever
engaged?"</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Why, engaged to be married."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Would you like to?"</p>
<p>"I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?"</p>
<p>"Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you
won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss
and that's all. Anybody can do it."</p>
<p>"Kiss? What do you kiss for?"</p>
<p>"Why, that, you know, is to&mdash;well, they always do
that."</p>
<p>"Everybody?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you
remember what I wrote on the slate?"</p>
<p>"Ye&mdash;yes."</p>
<p>"What was it?"</p>
<p>"I sha'n't tell you."</p>
<p>"Shall I tell YOU?"</p>
<p>"Ye&mdash;yes&mdash;but some other time."</p>
<p>"No, now."</p>
<p>"No, not now&mdash;to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky&mdash;I'll whisper it, I'll whisper
it ever so easy."</p>
<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his
arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his
mouth close to her ear. And then he added:</p>
<p>"Now you whisper it to me&mdash;just the same."</p>
<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>
<p>"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But
you mustn't ever tell anybody&mdash;WILL you, Tom? Now you won't,
WILL you?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky."</p>
<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath
stirred his curls and whispered, "I&mdash;love&mdash;you!"</p>
<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and
benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last,
with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her
neck and pleaded:</p>
<p>"Now, Becky, it's all done&mdash;all over but the kiss. Don't
you be afraid of that&mdash;it ain't anything at all. Please,
Becky." And he tugged at her apron and the hands.</p>
<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all
glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the
red lips and said:</p>
<p>"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you
ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry
anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry
anybody but you&mdash;and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me,
either."</p>
<p>"Certainly. Of course. That's PART of it. And always coming to
school or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there
ain't anybody looking&mdash;and you choose me and I choose you at
parties, because that's the way you do when you're engaged."</p>
<p>"It's so nice. I never heard of it before."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence&mdash;"</p>
<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged
to!"</p>
<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more."</p>
<p>"Yes, you do, Tom&mdash;you know you do."</p>

<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away
and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried
again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again.
Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He
stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the
door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find
him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he
was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make new
advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was
still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to
the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment,
not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"Becky, I&mdash;I don't care for anybody but you."</p>
<p>No reply&mdash;but sobs.</p>
<p>"Becky"&mdash;pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?"</p>
<p>More sobs.</p>
<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an
andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and
said:</p>
<p>"Please, Becky, won't you take it?"</p>
<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house
and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that
day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was
not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there.
Then she called:</p>
<p>"Tom! Come back, Tom!"</p>
<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no
companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again
and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather
again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart
and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with
none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.</p>

<p>TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well
out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody
jog. He crossed a small "branch" two or three times, because of a
prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled
pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas
mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the school-house was
hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He
entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it,
and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not
even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the
songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no
sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness
the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his
feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long
with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating.
It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more
than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very
peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and
ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the
grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and
grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school
record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as
to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in
the world, and been treated like a dog&mdash;like a very dog. She
would be sorry some day&mdash;maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he
could only die TEMPORARILY!</p>
<p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one
constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift
insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he
turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went
away&mdash;ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the
seas&mdash;and never came back any more! How would she feel then!
The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him
with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an
offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would
be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and
illustrious. No&mdash;better still, he would join the Indians, and
hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the
trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come
back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint,
and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a
blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his
companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something
gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! NOW his
future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable
splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people
shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in
his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with
his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame,
how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into
church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and
trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling
with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his
slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the
skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the
whisperings, "It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!&mdash;the Black Avenger
of the Spanish Main!"</p>

<br />
<p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run
away from home and enter upon it. He would start the very next
morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would collect
his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and
began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon
struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered
this incantation impressively:</p>
<p>"What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!"</p>
<p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He
took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose
bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's
astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a perplexed
air, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, that beats anything!"</p>
<p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating.
The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which
he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If
you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left
it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the
incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles
you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime,
no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing
had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom's whole structure of
faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of
this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not
occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself,
but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over
the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had
interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy
himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small
sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid
himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and
called&mdash;</p>
<p>"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!
Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!"</p>
<p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared
for a second and then darted under again in a fright.</p>
<p>"He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed
it."</p>
<p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches,
so he gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as
well have the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went
and made a patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he
went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just
as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he
took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way,
saying:</p>
<p>"Brother, go find your brother!"</p>
<p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it
must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The
last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot
of each other.</p>
<p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the
green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers,
turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the
rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin
trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away,
barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a
great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and
look warily out, this way and that. He said cautiously&mdash;to an
imaginary company:</p>
<p>"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."</p>
<p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as
Tom. Tom called:</p>
<p>"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?"</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<img alt="08-083.jpg (58K)" src="images/08-083.jpg" height="545"

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting&mdash;for
they talked "by the book," from memory.</p>
<p>"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?"</p>
<p>"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall
know."</p>
<p>"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I
dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!"</p>
<p>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the
ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave,
careful combat, "two up and two down." Presently Tom said:</p>
<p>"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!"</p>
<p>So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the work.
By and by Tom shouted:</p>
<p>"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"</p>
<p>"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the
worst of it."</p>
<p>"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it
is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he
slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit
you in the back."</p>
<p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned,
received the whack and fell.</p>
<p>"Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill YOU. That's
fair."</p>
<p>"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book."</p>
<p>"Well, it's blamed mean&mdash;that's all."</p>
<p>"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son,
and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of
Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me."</p>
<p>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out.
Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the
treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected
wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping
outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble
hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin
Hood under the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and fell
back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too
gaily for a corpse.</p>

<p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went
off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering
what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for
their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in
Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.</p>

<br />
<p>AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as
usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay
awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him
that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten!
This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves
demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and
stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by,
out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to
emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring
itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The
stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured,
muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could
locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the
wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder&mdash;it meant that
somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose
on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter
distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time
had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of
himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then
there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy
caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A
cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against
the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a
single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and
creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours. He "meow'd" with
caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the
woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with
his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At
the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of
the graveyard.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img086" id="img086"></a><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on
a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy
board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward
the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds
grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken
in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped,
worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support
and finding none. "Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been
painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the
most of them, now, even if there had been light.</p>
<p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might
be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The
boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and
the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their
spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and
ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that
grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.</p>
<p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The
hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead
stillness. Tom's reflections grew oppressive. He must force some
talk. So he said in a whisper:</p>
<p>"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be
here?"</p>
<p>Huckleberry whispered:</p>
<p>"I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?"</p>
<p>"I bet it is."</p>
<p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this
matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Say, Hucky&mdash;do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us
talking?"</p>
<p>"O' course he does. Least his sperrit does."</p>
<p>Tom, after a pause:</p>
<p>"I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm.
Everybody calls him Hoss."</p>
<p>"A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer
dead people, Tom."</p>
<p>This was a damper, and conversation died again.</p>
<p>Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:</p>
<p>"Sh!"</p>
<p>"What is it, Tom?" And the two clung together with beating
hearts.</p>
<p>"Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There! Now you hear it."</p>
<p>"Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we
do?"</p>
<p>"I dono. Think they'll see us?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I
hadn't come."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We
ain't doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't
notice us at all."</p>
<p>"I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver."</p>
<p>"Listen!"</p>
<p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A
muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the
graveyard.</p>
<p>"Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful."</p>
<p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:</p>
<p>"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're
goners! Can you pray?"</p>
<p>"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us.
'Now I lay me down to sleep, I&mdash;'"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Sh!"</p>
<p>"What is it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff
Potter's voice."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;'tain't so, is it?"</p>
<p>"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp
enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely&mdash;blamed
old rip!"</p>
<p>"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it.
Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red
hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o'
them voices; it's Injun Joe."</p>
<p>"That's so&mdash;that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was
devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?"</p>
<p>The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached
the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys'
hiding-place.</p>
<p>"Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the
lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.</p>
<p>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and
a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to
open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave
and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.
He was so close the boys could have touched him.</p>
<p>"Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out
at any moment."</p>
<p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there
was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their
freight of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a
spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within
another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.
They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and
dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the
clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and
the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its
place with the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut
off the dangling end of the rope and then said:</p>
<p>"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out
with another five, or here she stays."</p>
<p>"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.</p>
<p>"Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required
your pay in advance, and I've paid you."</p>
<p>"Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun Joe, approaching
the doctor, who was now standing. "Five years ago you drove me away
from your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for
something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and
when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your
father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The
Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've GOT you, and you
got to SETTLE, you know!"</p>
<p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by
this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian
on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had
grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and
main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.
Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion,
snatched up Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and
stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an
opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the
heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the earth
with it&mdash;and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance
and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He
reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood,
and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful
spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the
dark.</p>
<p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing
over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured
inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The
half-breed muttered:</p>
<p>"THAT score is settled&mdash;damn you."</p>
<p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in
Potter's open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin.
Three&mdash;four&mdash;five minutes passed, and then Potter began
to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it,
glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up,
pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him,
confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.</p>
<p>"Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.</p>
<p>"It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving.</p>
<p>"What did you do it for?"</p>
<p>"I! I never done it!"</p>
<p>"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."</p>
<p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p>
<p>"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But
it's in my head yet&mdash;worse'n when we started here. I'm all in
a muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me,
Joe&mdash;HONEST, now, old feller&mdash;did I do it? Joe, I never
meant to&mdash;'pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell
me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful&mdash;and him so young and
promising."</p>
<p>"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the
headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and
staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him,
just as he fetched you another awful clip&mdash;and here you've
laid, as dead as a wedge til now."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this
minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the
excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe.
I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe,
don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe&mdash;that's a good feller. I
always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you
remember? You WON'T tell, WILL you, Joe?" And the poor creature
dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his
appealing hands.</p>
<p>"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter,
and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can
say."</p>
<p>"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest
day I live." And Potter began to cry.</p>
<p>"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for
blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and
don't leave any tracks behind you."</p>
<p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The
half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:</p>
<p>"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum
as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's
gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place
by himself&mdash;chicken-heart!"</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed
corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no
inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again,
too.</p>

<p>THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to
time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an
enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some
outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the
aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.</p>
<p>"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!"
whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. "I can't stand it
much longer."</p>
<p>Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys
fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work
to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to
breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and
exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses
slowed down, and Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?"</p>
<p>"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it."</p>
<p>"Do you though?"</p>
<p>"Why, I KNOW it, Tom."</p>
<p>Tom thought a while, then he said:</p>
<p>"Who'll tell? We?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun
Joe DIDN'T hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead
sure as we're a laying here."</p>
<p>"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."</p>
<p>"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough.
He's generally drunk enough."</p>
<p>Tom said nothing&mdash;went on thinking. Presently he
whispered:</p>
<p>"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"</p>
<p>"What's the reason he don't know it?"</p>
<p>"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you
reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?"</p>
<p>"By hokey, that's so, Tom!"</p>
<p>"And besides, look-a-here&mdash;maybe that whack done for
HIM!"</p>
<p>"No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that;
and besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take
and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase
him. He says so, his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter,
of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack
might fetch him; I dono."</p>
<p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:</p>
<p>"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"</p>
<p>"Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil
wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we
was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now,
look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another&mdash;that's
what we got to do&mdash;swear to keep mum."</p>

width="795" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and
swear that we&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little
rubbishy common things&mdash;specially with gals, cuz THEY go back
on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff&mdash;but there orter
be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And blood."</p>
<p>Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark,
and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in
keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the
moon-light, took a little fragment of "red keel" out of his pocket,
got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines,
emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between
his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes. [See next
page.]</p>
<p>"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This
and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever
Tell and Rot."</p>
<p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in
writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin
from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:</p>
<p>"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have
verdigrease on it."</p>
<p>"What's verdigrease?"</p>
<p>"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it
once&mdash;you'll see."</p>
<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy
pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In
time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using
the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry
how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried
the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and
incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were
considered to be locked and the key thrown away.</p>
<p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of
the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.</p>
<p>"Tom," whispered Huckleberry, "does this keep us from EVER
telling&mdash;ALWAYS?"</p>
<p>"Of course it does. It don't make any difference WHAT happens,
we got to keep mum. We'd drop down dead&mdash;don't YOU know
that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon that's so."</p>
<p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog
set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside&mdash;within ten feet
of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of
fright.</p>
<p>"Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.</p>
<p>"I dono&mdash;peep through the crack. Quick!"</p>
<p>"No, YOU, Tom!"</p>
<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't DO it, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"</p>
<p>"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice.
It's Bull Harbison." *</p>
<p>[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have
spoken of him as "Harbison's Bull," but a son or a dog of that name
was "Bull Harbison."]</p>
<p>"Oh, that's good&mdash;I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to
death; I'd a bet anything it was a STRAY dog."</p>
<p>The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.</p>
<p>"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry.
"DO, Tom!"</p>
<p>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.
His whisper was hardly audible when he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!"</p>
<p>"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"</p>
<p>"Huck, he must mean us both&mdash;we're right together."</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake
'bout where I'LL go to. I been so wicked."</p>
<p>"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything
a feller's told NOT to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a
tried&mdash;but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off
this time, I lay I'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!" And Tom began
to snuffle a little.</p>
<p>"YOU bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it,
Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh,
LORDY, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."</p>
<p>Tom choked off and whispered:</p>
<p>"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!"</p>
<p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.</p>
<p>"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is
bully, you know. NOW who can he mean?"</p>
<p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.</p>
<p>"Sh! What's that?" he whispered.</p>
<p>"Sounds like&mdash;like hogs grunting. No&mdash;it's somebody
snoring, Tom."</p>
<p>"That IS it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used
to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you,
he just lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't
ever coming back to this town any more."</p>
<p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.</p>
<p>"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"</p>
<p>"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again
and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would
take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing
stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to
within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it
broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his
face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts
had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their
fears passed away now. They tip-toed out, through the broken
weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a
parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air
again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward.</p>
<p>"Oh, geeminy, it's HIM!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.</p>
<p>"Say, Tom&mdash;they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny
Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a
whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very
same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet."</p>
<p>"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie
Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very
next Saturday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting better,
too."</p>
<p>"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure
as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they
know all about these kind of things, Huck."</p>
<p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his
bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with
excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that
nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the
gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.</p>
<p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look
in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why
had he not been called&mdash;persecuted till he was up, as usual?
The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was
dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were
still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice
of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an
air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat
down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no
smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart
sink down to the depths.</p>
<p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost
brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was
not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and
break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin
himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it
was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand
whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried,
he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again,
and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an
imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful
toward Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back
gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took
his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day
before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes
and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat,
rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared
at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the
limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some
hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his
position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper.
He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his
heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!</p>
<p>This final feather broke the camel's back.</p>

<p>CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly
electrified with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet
un-dreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from group
to group, from house to house, with little less than telegraphic
speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holi-day for that afternoon;
the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it
had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff
Potter&mdash;so the story ran. And it was said that a belated
citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the "branch" about
one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once
sneaked off&mdash;suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town
had been ransacked for this "murderer" (the public are not slow in
the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that
he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in
every direction, and the Sheriff "was confident" that he would be
captured before night.</p>
<p>All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a
thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful
place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the
dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there
before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met
Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if
anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody
was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson
to grave robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch
him!" This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, "It was
a judgment; His hand is here."</p>
<p>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the
stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway
and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming
himself!"</p>
<p>"Who? Who?" from twenty voices.</p>
<p>"Muff Potter!"</p>
<p>"Hallo, he's stopped!&mdash;Look out, he's turning! Don't let
him get away!"</p>
<p>People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he
wasn't trying to get away&mdash;he only looked doubtful and
perplexed.</p>
<p>"Infernal impudence!" said a bystander; "wanted to come and take
a quiet look at his work, I reckon&mdash;didn't expect any
company."</p>
<p>The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through,
ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face
was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When
he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he
put his face in his hands and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it, friends," he sobbed; "'pon my word and honor I
never done it."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img103" id="img103"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="11-103.jpg (112K)" src="images/11-103.jpg" height="512"
width="674" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Who's accused you?" shouted a voice.</p>
<p>This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and
looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw
Injun Joe, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is that your knife?" and it was thrust before him by the
Sheriff.</p>
<p>Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased
him to the ground. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get&mdash;" He
shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture
and said, "Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em&mdash;it ain't any use any
more."</p>
<p>Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting
every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon
his head, and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And
when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their
wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed
prisoner's life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant
had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the
property of such a power as that.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?"
somebody said.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help it&mdash;I couldn't help it," Potter moaned. "I
wanted to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here."
And he fell to sobbing again.</p>
<p>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the
most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and
they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.</p>
<p>They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity
should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread
master.</p>
<p>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put
it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the
shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought
that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right
direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager
remarked:</p>
<p>"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it."</p>
<p>Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep
for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid
said:</p>
<p>"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you
keep me awake half the time."</p>
<p>Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on
your mind, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so
that he spilled his coffee.</p>
<p>"And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said,
'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and
over. And you said, 'Don't torment me so&mdash;I'll tell!' Tell
WHAT? What is it you'll tell?"</p>
<p>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what
might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of
Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it.
She said:</p>
<p>"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every
night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."</p>
<p>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed
satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly
could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and
tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly
watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned
on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward
slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind
wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was
discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's
disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.</p>
<p>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done
holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present
to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these
inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new
enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a
witness&mdash;and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the
fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and
always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing.
However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to
torture Tom's conscience.</p>
<p>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled
such small comforts through to the "murderer" as he could get hold
of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh
at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it;
indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to
ease Tom's conscience.</p>
<p>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe
and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was
his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take
the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to
begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without
confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was
deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.</p>

<p>ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its
secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to
interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school.
Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to "whistle
her down the wind," but failed. He began to find himself hanging
around her father's house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She
was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the
thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy.
The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left.
He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any
more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of
remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated
with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing
health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these
things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never
ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber
for all the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the
solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her
nostrils. All the "rot" they contained about ventilation, and how
to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to
drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to
keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all
gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of
the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended
the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day
was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her
quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with
death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
"hell following after." But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the
suffering neighbors.</p>

<p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a
windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood
him up in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold
water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so
brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him
away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and "the yellow
stains of it came through his pores"&mdash;as Tom said.</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more
melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths,
shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse.
She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and
blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's,
and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.</p>
<p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This
phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This
indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of
Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She
tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a
liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else,
and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and
watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were
instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the "indifference"
was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier
interest, if she had built a fire under him.</p>
<p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to
have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about
it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit
upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it
so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling
him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she
would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was
Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the
medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the
boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor
with it.</p>
<p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's
yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously,
and begging for a taste. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."</p>
<p>But Peter signified that he did want it.</p>
<p>"You better make sure."</p>
<p>Peter was sure.</p>
<p>"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there
ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it,
you mustn't blame anybody but your own self."</p>
<p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and
then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room,
banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making
general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in
a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his
voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing
around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.
Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double
summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the
open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old
lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses;
Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.</p>
<p>"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.</p>
<p>"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act
so?"</p>
<p>"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're
having a good time."</p>

<p>"They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made
Tom apprehensive.</p>
<p>"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."</p>
<p>"You DO?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest
emphasized by anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The handle
of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt
Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt
Polly raised him by the usual handle&mdash;his ear&mdash;and
cracked his head soundly with her thimble.</p>
<p>"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so,
for?"</p>
<p>"I done it out of pity for him&mdash;because he hadn't any
aunt."</p>
<p>"Hadn't any aunt!&mdash;you numskull. What has that got to do
with it?"</p>
<p>"Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself!
She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than
if he was a human!"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the
thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to
a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a
little, and she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:</p>
<p>"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you
good."</p>
<p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle
peeping through his gravity.</p>
<p>"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with
Peter. It done HIM good, too. I never see him get around so
since&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And
you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you
needn't take any more medicine."</p>
<p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this
strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as
usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of
playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it.
He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was
looking&mdash;down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight,
and Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned
sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led up"
warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad
never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever
a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon
as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to
appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the
empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock
passed in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next
instant he was out, and "going on" like an Indian; yelling,
laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and
limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head&mdash;doing all
the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye
out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she
seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be
possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his
exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around,
snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,
broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction,
and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting
her&mdash;and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard
her say: "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart&mdash;always
showing off!"</p>
<p>Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off,
crushed and crestfallen.</p>

<p>TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was
a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they
found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry;
he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him;
since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and
let them blame HIM for the consequences&mdash;why shouldn't they?
What right had the friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him
to it at last: he would lead a life of crime. There was no
choice.</p>
<p>By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for
school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now,
to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any
more&mdash;it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was
driven out into the cold world, he must submit&mdash;but he forgave
them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.</p>
<p>Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe
Harper&mdash;hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal
purpose in his heart. Plainly here were "two souls with but a
single thought." Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to
blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage
and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world
never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget
him.</p>
<p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just
been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that
purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which
he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she
was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there
was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy,
and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling
world to suffer and die.</p>
<p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact
to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till
death relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their
plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote
cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after
listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous
advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a
pirate.</p>
<p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the
Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long,
narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and
this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far
over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly
unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was chosen. Who were to be
the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to
them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them
promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent. They
presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two
miles above the village at the favorite hour&mdash;which was
midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to
capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he
could steal in the most dark and mysterious way&mdash;as became
outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to
enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the
town would "hear something." All who got this vague hint were
cautioned to "be mum and wait."</p>
<p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river
lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound
disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was
answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these
signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice
said:</p>
<p>"Who goes there?"</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your
names."</p>
<p>"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the
Seas." Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite
literature.</p>
<p>"'Tis well. Give the countersign."</p>
<p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously
to the brooding night:</p>
<p>"BLOOD!"</p>
<p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down
after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the
effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under
the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so
valued by a pirate.</p>
<p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had
about worn himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed
had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and
had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of
the pirates smoked or "chewed" but himself. The Black Avenger of
the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.
That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that
day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards
above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a
chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, "Hist!" every
now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with
hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal
whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to "let him have it to the
hilt," because "dead men tell no tales." They knew well enough that
the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or
having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting
this thing in an unpiratical way.</p>
<p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after
oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and
with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:</p>
<p>"Luff, and bring her to the wind!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Steady, steady-y-y-y!"</p>
<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>
<p>"Let her go off a point!"</p>
<p>"Point it is, sir!"</p>
<p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward
mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given
only for "style," and were not intended to mean anything in
particular.</p>
<p>"What sail's she carrying?"</p>
<p>"Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir."</p>
<p>"Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of
ye&mdash;foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! NOW my
hearties!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Hellum-a-lee&mdash;hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she
comes! Port, port! NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!"</p>
<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>

<p>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed
her head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high,
so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a
word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the
raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering
lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague
vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous
event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded
arms, "looking his last" upon the scene of his former joys and his
later sufferings, and wishing "she" could see him now, abroad on
the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to
his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain
on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eye-shot of
the village, and so he "looked his last" with a broken and
satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too;
and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current
drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the
danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in
the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above
the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they
had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings
consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the
bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves
would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.</p>
<p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or
thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then
cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of
the corn "pone" stock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to
be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an
unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and
they said they never would return to civilization. The climbing
fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared
tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage
and festooning vines.</p>
<p>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last
allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out
on the grass, filled with contentment. They could have found a
cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic
feature as the roasting campfire.</p>

<p>"AIN'T it gay?" said Joe.</p>
<p>"It's NUTS!" said Tom. "What would the boys say if they could
see us?"</p>
<p>"Say? Well, they'd just die to be here&mdash;hey, Hucky!"</p>
<p>"I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways, I'm suited. I don't
want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat,
gen'ally&mdash;and here they can't come and pick at a feller and
bullyrag him so."</p>
<p>"It's just the life for me," said Tom. "You don't have to get
up, mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all
that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do ANYTHING,
Joe, when he's ashore, but a hermit HE has to be praying
considerable, and then he don't have any fun, anyway, all by
himself that way."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, that's so," said Joe, "but I hadn't thought much about
it, you know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've
tried it."</p>
<p>"You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits, nowadays,
like they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected.
And a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and
put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?" inquired
Huck.</p>
<p>"I dono. But they've GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have
to do that if you was a hermit."</p>
<p>"Dern'd if I would," said Huck.</p>
<p>"Well, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"I dono. But I wouldn't do that."</p>
<p>"Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to. How'd you get around it?"</p>
<p>"Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away."</p>
<p>"Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit.
You'd be a disgrace."</p>
<p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had
finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it,
loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and
blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke&mdash;he was in the full bloom of
luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic
vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck
said:</p>
<p>"What does pirates have to do?"</p>
<p>Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh, they have just a bully time&mdash;take ships and burn them,
and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where
there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the
ships&mdash;make 'em walk a plank."</p>
<p>"And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't
kill the women."</p>
<p>"No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women&mdash;they're too
noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.</p>
<p>"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and
silver and di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Huck.</p>
<p>"Why, the pirates."</p>
<p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.</p>
<p>"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; "but I ain't got none but
these."</p>
<p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast
enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made
him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it
was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper
wardrobe.</p>
<p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon
the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers
of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free
and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the
Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said
their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody
there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth,
they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to
proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden
and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and
hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep&mdash;but an intruder
came, now, that would not "down." It was conscience. They began to
feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and
next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture
came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they
had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience
was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to
them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn
fact that taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while taking bacon
and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing&mdash;and
there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly
resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their
piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.
Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent
pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</p>

<br />
<p>WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat
up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It
was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose
and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not
a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's
meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A
white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of
smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.</p>
<p>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered;
presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the
cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds
multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking
off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A
little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting
two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and "sniffing
around," then proceeding again&mdash;for he was measuring, Tom
said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat
as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns,
as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go
elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg
and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad&mdash;for
that meant that he was going to have a new suit of
clothes&mdash;without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical
uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in
particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by
with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and
lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug
climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close
to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is
on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to
see about it&mdash;which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of
old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had
practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came
next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature,
to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead.
The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern
mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her
imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a
shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed
the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big
fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at
intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things
had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew
whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and
stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the
dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering
upon the scene.</p>
<p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away
with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing
after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of
the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village
sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A
vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their
raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something
like burning the bridge between them and civilization.</p>

<br />
<p>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck
found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups
of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with
such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute
for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck
asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in
the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they
had reward. Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were
back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a
small catfish&mdash;provisions enough for quite a family. They
fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had
ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker
a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he
is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make,
too.</p>
<p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a
smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring
expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through
tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from
their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines.
Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and
jeweled with flowers.</p>

<p>They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to
be astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three
miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay
closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly
two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it
was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to
camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared
sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the
shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then died. The
stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense
of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They
fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
took dim shape, presently&mdash;it was budding homesickness. Even
Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty
hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and none
was brave enough to speak his thought.</p>
<p>For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a
peculiar sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the
ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this
mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition.
The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a
listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and
unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the
distance.</p>
<p>"What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Tom in a whisper.</p>
<p>"'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz
thunder&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hark!" said Tom. "Listen&mdash;don't talk."</p>
<p>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled
boom troubled the solemn hush.</p>
<p>"Let's go and see."</p>
<p>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the
town. They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the
water. The little steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the
village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded
with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or
floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but
the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.
Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's
side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull
throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>"I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!"</p>
<p>"That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill
Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that
makes him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread
and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's
anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes the
bread do that."</p>
<p>"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's
mostly what they SAY over it before they start it out."</p>
<p>"But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em
and they don't."</p>
<p>"Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to
themselves. Of COURSE they do. Anybody might know that."</p>
<p>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said,
because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation,
could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an
errand of such gravity.</p>
<p>"By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.</p>
<p>"I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is."</p>
<p>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing
thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Boys, I know who's drownded&mdash;it's us!"</p>
<p>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous
triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking
on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of
unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing
regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the
departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the
boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was
fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.</p>
<p>As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed
business and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp.
They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the
illustrious trouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked
supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village
was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of
the public distress on their account were gratifying to look
upon&mdash;from their point of view. But when the shadows of night
closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into
the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The
excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back
thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine
frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled
and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly
ventured upon a roundabout "feeler" as to how the others might look
upon a return to civilization&mdash;not right now, but&mdash;</p>
<p>Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet,
joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and was
glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of
chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his garments as he could.
Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.</p>

<p>As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to
snore. Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for
some time, watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously,
on his knees, and went searching among the grass and the flickering
reflections flung by the campfire. He picked up and inspected
several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore,
and finally chose two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by
the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his
"red keel"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the
other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from
the owner. And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures
of almost inestimable value&mdash;among them a lump of chalk, an
India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles
known as a "sure 'nough crystal." Then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing,
and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the
sandbar.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar,
wading toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his
middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no more
wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining
hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept
downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached
the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and
drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his
piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following
the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o'clock he
came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.
Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the
bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam
three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did "yawl"
duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts
and waited, panting.</p>
<p>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to
"cast off." A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing
high up, against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom
felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip
for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the
wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the
dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible
stragglers.</p>
<p>He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at
his aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell," and
looked in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning
there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother,
grouped together, talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was
between them and the door. Tom went to the door and began to softly
lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a
crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it
creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so
he put his head through and began, warily.</p>
<p>"What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried
up. "Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end
of strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid."</p>
<p>Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and
"breathed" himself for a time, and then crept to where he could
almost touch his aunt's foot.</p>
<p>"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't BAD, so to
say&mdash;only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you
know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant
any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was"&mdash;and
she began to cry.</p>
<p>"It was just so with my Joe&mdash;always full of his devilment,
and up to every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and
kind as he could be&mdash;and laws bless me, to think I went and
whipped him for taking that cream, never once recollecting that I
throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I never to see him
again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!" And
Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>
<p>"I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd
been better in some ways&mdash;"</p>
<p>"SID!" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could
not see it. "Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll
take care of HIM&mdash;never you trouble YOURself, sir! Oh, Mrs.
Harper, I don't know how to give him up! I don't know how to give
him up! He was such a comfort to me, although he tormented my old
heart out of me, 'most."</p>

<br />
<p>"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away&mdash;Blessed be
the name of the Lord! But it's so hard&mdash;Oh, it's so hard! Only
last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I
knocked him sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon&mdash;Oh,
if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know
just exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my
Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think
the cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked
Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out
of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say
was to reproach&mdash;"</p>
<p>But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke
entirely down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself&mdash;and more in
pity of himself than anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and
putting in a kindly word for him from time to time. He began to
have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before. Still, he was
sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from
under the bed and overwhelm her with joy&mdash;and the theatrical
gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but
he resisted and lay still.</p>
<p>He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a
swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said
the missing lads had promised that the village should "hear
something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this and that together"
and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn
up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had
been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six
miles below the village&mdash;and then hope perished; they must be
drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if
not sooner. It was believed that the search for the bodies had been
a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred
in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the
bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given
over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom
shuddered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with
a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each
other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt
Polly was tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and
Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her
heart.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so
appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her
old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long
before she was through.</p>
<p>He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept
making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing
unrestfully, and turning over. But at last she was still, only
moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose
gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand,
and stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He
took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But
something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His face
lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips,
and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind
him.</p>
<p>He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at
large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she
was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned
in and slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern,
slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he
had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across
and bent himself stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the
other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him. He
was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered
a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a
thorough search would be made for it and that might end in
revelations. So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.</p>
<p>He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to
keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The
night was far spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself
fairly abreast the island bar. He rested again until the sun was
well up and gilding the great river with its splendor, and then he
plunged into the stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon
the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:</p>
<p>"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't
desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's
too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other.
Now I wonder what?"</p>

<p>"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"</p>
<p>"Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he
ain't back here to breakfast."</p>
<p>"Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect,
stepping grandly into camp.</p>
<p>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided,
and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned)
his adventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes
when the tale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook
to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and
explore.</p>

<p>AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on
the bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they
found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their
hands. Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one
hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than
an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night,
and another on Friday morning.</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar,
and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they
went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away
up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which
latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and
greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group
and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms,
gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the
strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the
best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a
tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering,
laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.</p>
<p>When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on
the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it,
and by and by break for the water again and go through the original
performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked
skin represented flesh-colored "tights" very fairly; so they drew a
ring in the sand and had a circus&mdash;with three clowns in it,
for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.</p>
<p>Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ringtaw"
and "keeps" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had
another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in
kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake
rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so
long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not
venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other
boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart,
dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly across the
wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom found
himself writing "BECKY" in the sand with his big toe; he scratched
it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote
it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once
more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other
boys together and joining them.</p>
<p>But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He
was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The
tears lay very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was
downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which
he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was
not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a
great show of cheerfulness:</p>
<p>"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll
explore it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you
feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and
silver&mdash;hey?"</p>
<p>But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no
reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too.
It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick
and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so
lonesome."</p>
<p>"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just
think of the fishing that's here."</p>
<p>"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."</p>
<p>"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place
anywhere."</p>
<p>"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when
there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home."</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Yes, I DO want to see my mother&mdash;and you would, too, if
you had one. I ain't any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled
a little.</p>
<p>"Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we,
Huck? Poor thing&mdash;does it want to see its mother? And so it
shall. You like it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't
we?"</p>
<p>Huck said, "Y-e-s"&mdash;without any heart in it.</p>
<p>"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe,
rising. "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress
himself.</p>
<p>"Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and
get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't
crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I
reckon we can get along without him, per'aps."</p>
<p>But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go
sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see
Huck eying Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an
ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to
wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He
glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his
eyes. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and
now it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom."</p>
<p>"I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay."</p>
<p>"Tom, I better go."</p>
<p>"Well, go 'long&mdash;who's hendering you."</p>
<p>Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:</p>
<p>"Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait
for you when we get to shore."</p>
<p>"Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all."</p>
<p>Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him,
with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go
along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded
slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely
and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then
darted after his comrades, yelling:</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!"</p>
<p>They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where
they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily
till at last they saw the "point" he was driving at, and then they
set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was "splendid!" and said
if he had told them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He
made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that
not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length
of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last
seduction.</p>
<p>The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a
will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and
admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom
said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and
said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them.
These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of
grapevine, and they "bit" the tongue, and were not considered manly
anyway.</p>
<p>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to
puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an
unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:</p>
<p>"Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a
learnt long ago."</p>
<p>"So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing."</p>
<p>"Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought
well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could," said
Tom.</p>
<p>"That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me
talk just that way&mdash;haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck
if I haven't."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;heaps of times," said Huck.</p>
<p>"Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times. Once down
by the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was
there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't
you remember, Huck, 'bout me saying that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a
white alley. No, 'twas the day before."</p>
<p>"There&mdash;I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it."</p>
<p>"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't
feel sick."</p>
<p>"Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet
you Jeff Thatcher couldn't."</p>
<p>"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just
let him try it once. HE'D see!"</p>
<p>"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller&mdash;I wish could see Johnny
Miller tackle it once."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't
any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch
HIM."</p>
<p>"'Deed it would, Joe. Say&mdash;I wish the boys could see us
now."</p>
<p>"So do I."</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when
they're around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I
want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it
warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and another
one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's
all right, if it's STRONG enough.' And then you'll out with the
pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just see 'em
look!"</p>
<p>"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!"</p>
<p>"So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off
pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I reckon not! I'll just BET they will!"</p>
<p>So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and
grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration
marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a
spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under
their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little
overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could
do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were
looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe's pipe dropped from his
nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were going
furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said
feebly:</p>
<p>"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it."</p>
<p>Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:</p>
<p>"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the
spring. No, you needn't come, Huck&mdash;we can find it."</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it
lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in
the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed
him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.</p>
<p>They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble
look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going
to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very
well&mdash;something they ate at dinner had disagreed with
them.</p>
<p>About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a
brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something.
The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly
companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the
breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and
waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire
everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently
there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a
moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little
stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the
branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon
their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the
Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and
distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and
tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in
the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the
leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire.
Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash
followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys'
heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that
followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.</p>
<p>"Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img141" id="img141"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="16-141.jpg (111K)" src="images/16-141.jpg" height="953"
width="366" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the
dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared
through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding
flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder.
And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove
it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other,
but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their
voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and
took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with
water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be
grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so
furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The
tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose
from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys
seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and
bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the
riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless
conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything
below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the
bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving
spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the
other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the
slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded
the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the
unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts,
keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in
one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to
pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and
deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was
a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.</p>
<p>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with
weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed
her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they
found there was still something to be thankful for, because the
great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted
by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe
happened.</p>
<p>Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they
were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no
provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were
soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress;
but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up
under the great log it had been built against (where it curved
upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or
so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with
shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs,
they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead
boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once
more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that
they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight
adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on,
anywhere around.</p>
<p>As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over
them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They
got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting
breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a
little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering
up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for
marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of
the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he
got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being
pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were
attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were
stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so
many zebras&mdash;all of them chiefs, of course&mdash;and then they
went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.</p>
<p>By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted
upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and
scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it
was an extremely satisfactory one.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but
now a difficulty arose&mdash;hostile Indians could not break the
bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this
was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There
was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the
savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was
no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could
muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed,
in due form.</p>
<p>And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they
had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little
without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get
sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to
fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised
cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they
spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their
new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and
skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to smoke and
chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
present.</p>

<br />
<p>BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil
Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were
being put into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An
unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily
quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers conducted their
concerns with an absent air, and talked little; but they sighed
often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children. They
had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the
deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she
found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:</p>
<p>"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got
anything now to remember him by." And she choked back a little
sob.</p>
<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>
<p>"It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't
say that&mdash;I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone
now; I'll never, never, never see him any more."</p>
<p>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears
rolling down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and
girls&mdash;playmates of Tom's and Joe's&mdash;came by, and stood
looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how
Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him, and how Joe said this
and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could
easily see now!)&mdash;and each speaker pointed out the exact spot
where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added something
like "and I was a-standing just so&mdash;just as I am now, and as
if you was him&mdash;I was as close as that&mdash;and he smiled,
just this way&mdash;and then something seemed to go all over me,
like&mdash;awful, you know&mdash;and I never thought what it meant,
of course, but I can see now!"</p>
<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in
life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered
evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it
was ultimately decided who DID see the departed last, and exchanged
the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon themselves a
sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all the
rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with
tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:</p>
<p>"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once."</p>
<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say
that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group
loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed
voices.</p>
<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the
bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a
very still Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with
the musing hush that lay upon nature. The villagers began to
gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers
about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only
the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their
seats disturbed the silence there. None could remember when the
little church had been so full before. There was finally a waiting
pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly entered, followed
by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in deep black,
and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front
pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by
muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and
prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: "I am the
Resurrection and the Life."</p>
<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of
the graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads
that every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt
a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to
them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults and
flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a touching
incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their
sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how
noble and beautiful those episodes were, and remembered with grief
that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities,
well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation became more and
more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole
company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of
anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings,
and crying in the pulpit.</p>
<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a
moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his
streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First
one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister's, and then
almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the
three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe
next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the
rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their
own funeral sermon!</p>
<p>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their
restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out
thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not
knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many
unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom
seized him and said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see
Huck."</p>
<p>"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!"
And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one
thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was
before.</p>
<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise
God from whom all blessings flow&mdash;SING!&mdash;and put your
hearts in it!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst,
and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around
upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart
that this was the proudest moment of his life.</p>
<p>As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would
almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred
sung like that once more.</p>
<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day&mdash;according to Aunt
Polly's varying moods&mdash;than he had earned before in a year;
and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and
affection for himself.</p>

<br />
<p>THAT was Tom's great secret&mdash;the scheme to return home with
his brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled
over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing
five or six miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at
the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had then crept
through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the
gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.</p>
<p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very
loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an
unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a
pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you
could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come
over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run
off."</p>
<p>"Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe
you would if you had thought of it."</p>
<p>"Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully.
"Say, now, would you, if you'd thought of it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled
everything."</p>
<p>"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a
grieved tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been
something if you'd cared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't
DO it."</p>
<p>"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only
Tom's giddy way&mdash;he is always in such a rush that he never
thinks of anything."</p>
<p>"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have
come and DONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's
too late, and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would
have cost you so little."</p>
<p>"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.</p>
<p>"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."</p>
<p>"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but
I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"It ain't much&mdash;a cat does that much&mdash;but it's better
than nothing. What did you dream?"</p>
<p>"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there
by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to
him."</p>
<p>"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could
take even that much trouble about us."</p>
<p>"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."</p>
<p>"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now."</p>
<p>"Well, try to recollect&mdash;can't you?"</p>
<p>"Somehow it seems to me that the wind&mdash;the wind blowed
the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!"</p>
<p>Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and
then said:</p>
<p>"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!"</p>
<p>"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom&mdash;go on!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that
door&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Go ON, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Just let me study a moment&mdash;just a moment. Oh,
yes&mdash;you said you believed the door was open."</p>
<p>"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"</p>
<p>"And then&mdash;and then&mdash;well I won't be certain, but it
seems like as if you made Sid go and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him
do?"</p>
<p>"You made him&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, you made him shut it."</p>
<p>"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in
all my days! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any
more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older.
I'd like to see her get around THIS with her rubbage 'bout
superstition. Go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said
I warn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
responsible than&mdash;than&mdash;I think it was a colt, or
something."</p>
<p>"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"And then you began to cry."</p>
<p>"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And
then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the
same, and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when
she'd throwed it out her own self&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a
prophesying&mdash;that's what you was doing! Land alive, go on,
Tom!"</p>
<p>"Then Sid he said&mdash;he said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.</p>
<p>"Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.</p>
<p>"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"</p>
<p>"He said&mdash;I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I
was gone to, but if I'd been better sometimes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!"</p>
<p>"And you shut him up sharp."</p>
<p>"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an
angel there, somewheres!"</p>
<p>"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker,
and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Just as true as I live!"</p>
<p>"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river
for us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old
Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went."</p>
<p>"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm
a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like
if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Then I thought you prayed for me&mdash;and I could see you and
hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry
that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't
dead&mdash;we are only off being pirates,' and put it on the table
by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep,
that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the
lips."</p>
<p>"Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!"
And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel
like the guiltiest of villains.</p>
<p>"It was very kind, even though it was only a&mdash;dream," Sid
soliloquized just audibly.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do
if he was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you,
Tom, if you was ever found again&mdash;now go 'long to school. I'm
thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back,
that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and
keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if
only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help
them over the rough places, there's few enough would smile here or
ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid,
Mary, Tom&mdash;take yourselves off&mdash;you've hendered me long
enough."</p>
<p>The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs.
Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid
had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind
as he left the house. It was this: "Pretty thin&mdash;as long a
dream as that, without any mistakes in it!"</p>
<p>What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and
prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who
felt that the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried
not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed
along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys than
himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and
tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a
procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town. Boys of
his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but
they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have given
anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his
glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for
a circus.</p>

<p>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and
delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two
heroes were not long in becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They
began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners&mdash;but they
only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with
imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when
they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very
summit of glory was reached.</p>
<p>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now.
Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was
distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let
her&mdash;she should see that he could be as indifferent as some
other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her.
He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to
talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth
with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing
schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture;
but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity,
and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at
such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in
him; and so, instead of winning him, it only "set him up" the more
and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she
was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively
and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was
talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She
felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried
to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the
group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow&mdash;with
sham vivacity:</p>
<p>"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to
Sunday-school?"</p>
<p>"I did come&mdash;didn't you see me?"</p>
<p>"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?"</p>
<p>"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU."</p>
<p>"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you
about the picnic."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"</p>
<p>"My ma's going to let me have one."</p>
<p>"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come."</p>
<p>"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come
that I want, and I want you."</p>
<p>"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"</p>
<p>"By and by. Maybe about vacation."</p>
<p>"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and
boys?"</p>
<p>"Yes, every one that's friends to me&mdash;or wants to be"; and
she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to
Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the
lightning tore the great sycamore tree "all to flinders" while he
was "standing within three feet of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And me?" said Sally Rogers.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had
begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly
away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled
and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced
gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the
picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as
she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry."
Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She
roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her
plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D do.</p>

<p>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and
lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there
was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a
little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with
Alfred Temple&mdash;and so absorbed were they, and their heads so
close together over the book, that they did not seem to be
conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot
through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the
chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a
fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry
with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her
heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He did
not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often
misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the
schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful
spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see,
as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that
he was even in the land of the living. But she did see,
nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was
glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</p>

<br />
<p>Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he
had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting.
But in vain&mdash;the girl chirped on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her,
ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" At last he must be attending
to those things&mdash;and she said artlessly that she would be
"around" when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for
it.</p>

<br />
<p>"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the
whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so
fine and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day
you ever saw this town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just
wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and&mdash;"</p>
<p>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary
boy&mdash;pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do,
do you? You holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!"
And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more
of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of
the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with
Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer,
her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and
absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times
she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no
Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't
carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her,
he did not know how, kept exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one! look
at this!" she lost patience at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother
me! I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and
walked away.</p>
<p>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her,
but she said:</p>
<p>"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"</p>
<p>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done&mdash;for
she had said she would look at pictures all through the
nooning&mdash;and she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing
into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He
easily guessed his way to the truth&mdash;the girl had simply made
a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far
from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He
wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was
his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the
afternoon and poured ink upon the page.</p>

<p>Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the
act, and moved on, without discovering herself. She started
homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be
thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was half
way home, however, she had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's
treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came
scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him
get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate him
forever, into the bargain.</p>

<br />
<p>TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his
aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
unpromising market:</p>
<p>"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"</p>
<p>"Auntie, what have I done?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like
an old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that
rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out
from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that
night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that will act
like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to
Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a
word."</p>
<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning
had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely
looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of
anything to say for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it&mdash;but I didn't think."</p>
<p>"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but
your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here
from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and
you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you
couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow."</p>
<p>"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I
didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at
you that night."</p>
<p>"What did you come for, then?"</p>
<p>"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't
got drownded."</p>
<p>"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I
could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know
you never did&mdash;and I know it, Tom."</p>
<p>"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie&mdash;I wish I may never stir if
I didn't."</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, don't lie&mdash;don't do it. It only makes things a
hundred times worse."</p>
<p>"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you
from grieving&mdash;that was all that made me come."</p>
<p>"I'd give the whole world to believe that&mdash;it would cover
up a power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted
so bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me,
child?"</p>
<p>"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just
got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church,
and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark
back in my pocket and kept mum."</p>
<p>"What bark?"</p>
<p>"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish,
now, you'd waked up when I kissed you&mdash;I do, honest."</p>
<p>The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden
tenderness dawned in her eyes.</p>
<p>"DID you kiss me, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I did."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you did, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I did, auntie&mdash;certain sure."</p>
<p>"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so
sorry."</p>
<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a
tremor in her voice when she said:</p>
<p>"Kiss me again, Tom!&mdash;and be off with you to school, now,
and don't bother me any more."</p>
<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin
of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with
it in her hand, and said to herself:</p>
<p>"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about
it&mdash;but it's a blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort
come from it. I hope the Lord&mdash;I KNOW the Lord will forgive
him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I
don't want to find out it's a lie. I won't look."</p>
<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she
put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she
refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified
herself with the thought: "It's a good lie&mdash;it's a good
lie&mdash;I won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket
pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through
flowing tears and saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd
committed a million sins!"</p>

<br />
<p>THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed
Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and
happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon
Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always
determined his manner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her
and said:</p>
<p>"I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't
ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live&mdash;please
make up, won't you?"</p>
<p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p>
<p>"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer.
I'll never speak to you again."</p>
<p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he
had not even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss
Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said
nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the
schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would
trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered
a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the
angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot
resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to "take in," she
was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.
If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple,
Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.</p>
<p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble
herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an
unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a
doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher
than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book
out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes
were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not
an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but
the chance never came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the
nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was
no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was
passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that
the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced
around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book
in her hands. The titlepage&mdash;Professor Somebody's
ANATOMY&mdash;carried no information to her mind; so she began to
turn the leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and
colored frontispiece&mdash;a human figure, stark naked. At that
moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the
door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the
book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page
half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned
the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on
a person and look at what they're looking at."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img163" id="img163"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="20-163.jpg (54K)" src="images/20-163.jpg" height="490"
width="361" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"How could I know you was looking at anything?"</p>
<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know
you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I
do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school."</p>
<p>Then she stamped her little foot and said:</p>
<p>"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to
happen. You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful,
hateful!"&mdash;and she flung out of the house with a new explosion
of crying.</p>
<p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently
he said to himself:</p>
<p>"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in
school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a
girl&mdash;they're so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of
course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool,
because there's other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so
mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his
book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way he always
does&mdash;ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the
right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always
tell on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well,
it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there
ain't any way out of it." Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and
then added: "All right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a
fix&mdash;let her sweat it out!"</p>
<p>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few
moments the master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a
strong interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the
girls' side of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all
things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do
to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy
the name. Presently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's
mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that.
Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good
interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get
out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book
himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the
thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and
she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not
certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to
get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced
herself to keep still&mdash;because, said she to herself, "he'll
tell about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not
to save his life!"</p>
<p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had
unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some
skylarking bout&mdash;he had denied it for form's sake and because
it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.</p>
<p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne,
the air was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins
straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and
reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out
or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there
were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes.
Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it
out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at
Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did,
with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel
with her. Quick&mdash;something must be done! done in a flash, too!
But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
Good!&mdash;he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the
book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for
one little instant, and the chance was lost&mdash;the master opened
the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too
late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the
master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was
that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was
silence while one might count ten&mdash;the master was gathering
his wrath. Then he spoke: "Who tore this book?"</p>
<p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The
stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs
of guilt.</p>
<p>"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"</p>
<p>A denial. Another pause.</p>
<p>"Joseph Harper, did you?"</p>
<p>Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense
under the slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the
ranks of boys&mdash;considered a while, then turned to the
girls:</p>
<p>"Amy Lawrence?"</p>
<p>A shake of the head.</p>
<p>"Gracie Miller?"</p>
<p>The same sign.</p>
<p>"Susan Harper, did you do this?"</p>
<p>Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was
trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the
hopelessness of the situation.</p>
<p>"Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face&mdash;it was white
with terror]&mdash;"did you tear&mdash;no, look me in the face"
[her hands rose in appeal]&mdash;"did you tear this book?"</p>
<p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to
his feet and shouted&mdash;"I done it!"</p>

width="352" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom
stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he
stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the
gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's
eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the
splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most
merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and
also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to
remain two hours after school should be dismissed&mdash;for he knew
who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.</p>
<p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred
Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not
forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance
had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at
last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his
ear&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tom, how COULD you be so noble!"</p>

<p>VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew
severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to
make a good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule
were seldom idle now&mdash;at least among the smaller pupils. Only
the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped
lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for
although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny
head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of
feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the
tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The
consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror
and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away
no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all
the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was
so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the
field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a
plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the
signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had
his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his
father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The
master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and
there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master
always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well
fuddled, and the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had
reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would
"manage the thing" while he napped in his chair; then he would have
him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.</p>
<p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At
eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and
adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The
master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with
his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three
rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were
occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the
pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious
temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to
take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys,
washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of
gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn
and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon
and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled
with non-participating scholars.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly
recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on
the stage," etc.&mdash;accompanying himself with the painfully
exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have
used&mdash;supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But
he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round
of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.</p>
<p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb," etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause,
and sat down flushed and happy.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared
into the unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give
me death" speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and
broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him,
his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke. True, he had
the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house's silence,
too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master frowned,
and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then
retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause,
but it died early.</p>
<p>"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian
Came Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading
exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited
with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order,
now&mdash;original "compositions" by the young ladies. Each in her
turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her
throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and
proceeded to read, with labored attention to "expression" and
punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated
upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their
grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line
clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was one; "Memories of
Other Days"; "Religion in History"; "Dream Land"; "The Advantages
of Culture"; "Forms of Political Government Compared and
Contrasted"; "Melancholy"; "Filial Love"; "Heart Longings," etc.,
etc.</p>

width="677" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and
petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine
language"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears
particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely
out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them
was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled
tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the
subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into
some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could
contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these
sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion
from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be
sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in
all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close
their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon
of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is
always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of
this. Homely truth is unpalatable.</p>
<p>Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that
was read was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the reader
can endure an extract from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does
the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of
festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of
joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid
the festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her graceful
form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the
joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay
assembly.</p>
<p>"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the
welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of
which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does
everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more
charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath
this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once
charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has
lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she
turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot
satisfy the longings of the soul!"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from
time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered
ejaculations of "How sweet!" "How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and
after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the
applause was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the
"interesting" paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and
read a "poem." Two stanzas of it will do:</p>
<h4>"A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</h4>
<table summary="">
<tr>
<td>"Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!<br />
But yet for a while do I leave thee now!<br />
Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,<br />
And burning recollections throng my brow!<br />
For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;<br />
Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;<br />
Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,<br />
And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.<br />
<br />
"Yet shame I not to bear an o'erfull heart,<br />
Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;<br />
'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,<br />
'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.<br />
Welcome and home were mine within this State,<br />
Whose vales I leave&mdash;whose spires fade fast from me<br />
And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,<br />
When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!"</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There were very few there who knew what "tete" meant, but the
poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired
young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic
expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:</p>
<br />

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"A VISION</p>
<p>"Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a
single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder
constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning
revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven,
seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the
illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came
forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance
by their aid the wildness of the scene.</p>
<p>"At such a time, so dark,so dreary, for human sympathy my very
spirit sighed; but instead thereof,</p>
<p>"'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and
guide&mdash;My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my
side. She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the
sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of
beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft
was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the
magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive
beauties, she would have glided away unperceived&mdash;unsought. A
strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the
robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements
without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound
up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians
that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be
the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in
delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in
which he said that it was by far the most "eloquent" thing he had
ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be
proud of it.</p>
<p>It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions
in which the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and human
experience referred to as "life's page," was up to the usual
average.</p>
<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his
chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a
map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class
upon. But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and
a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter
was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade
them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering
was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work,
now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that
all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and
yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well
it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his
head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around
the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and
jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved
upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at
the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher&mdash;the
cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's
head&mdash;down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with
her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the
garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And
how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald
pate&mdash;for the signpainter's boy had GILDED it!</p>

<p>TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being
attracted by the showy character of their "regalia." He promised to
abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained
a member. Now he found out a new thing&mdash;namely, that to
promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a
body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself
tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be
so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself
in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of
July was coming; but he soon gave that up&mdash;gave it up before
he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours&mdash;and fixed his
hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was
apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral,
since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply
concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it.
Sometimes his hopes ran high&mdash;so high that he would venture to
get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the
Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was
pronounced upon the mend&mdash;and then convalescent. Tom was
disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his
resignation at once&mdash;and that night the Judge suffered a
relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like
that again.</p>
<p>The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style
calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy
again, however&mdash;there was something in that. He could drink
and swear, now&mdash;but found to his surprise that he did not want
to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the
charm of it.</p>
<p>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was
beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.</p>
<p>He attempted a diary&mdash;but nothing happened during three
days, and so he abandoned it.</p>
<p>The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made
a sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and
were happy for two days.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it
rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the
greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual
United States Senator, proved an overwhelming
disappointment&mdash;for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even
anywhere in the neighborhood of it.</p>
<p>A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward
in tents made of rag carpeting&mdash;admission, three pins for
boys, two for girls&mdash;and then circusing was abandoned.</p>
<p>A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came&mdash;and went again and
left the village duller and drearier than ever.</p>
<p>There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few
and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache
the harder.</p>
<p>Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with
her parents during vacation&mdash;so there was no bright side to
life anywhere.</p>
<p>The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a
very cancer for permanency and pain.</p>
<p>Then came the measles.</p>

<br />
<p>During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and
its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When
he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a
melancholy change had come over everything and every creature.
There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got religion," not
only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom went about,
hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but
disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying
a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.
He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a basket
of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the
precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he
encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry
Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke
and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the
town was lost, forever and forever.</p>
<p>And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving
rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He
covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of
suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that
all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the
forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and
that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of
pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but
there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an
expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an
insect like himself.</p>
<p>By and by the tempest spent itself and died without
accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be
grateful, and reform. His second was to wait&mdash;for there might
not be any more storms.</p>
<p>The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three
weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he
got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared,
remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and
forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim
Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat
for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Joe
Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads!
they&mdash;like Tom&mdash;had suffered a relapse.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred&mdash;and vigorously:
the murder trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing
topic of village talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it.
Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his
troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these
remarks were put forth in his hearing as "feelers"; he did not see
how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but
still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It
kept him in a cold shiver all the time. He took Huck to a lonely
place to have a talk with him. It would be some relief to unseal
his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress
with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that
Huck had remained discreet.</p>
<p>"Huck, have you ever told anybody about&mdash;that?"</p>
<p>"'Bout what?"</p>
<p>"You know what."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;'course I haven't."</p>
<p>"Never a word?"</p>
<p>"Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was afeard."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got
found out. YOU know that."</p>
<p>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p>
<p>"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"</p>
<p>"Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd
me they could get me to tell. They ain't no different way."</p>
<p>"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we
keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer."</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>
<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>
<p>"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."</p>
<p>"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all
the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide
som'ers."</p>
<p>"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a
goner. Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"</p>
<p>"Most always&mdash;most always. He ain't no account; but then he
hain't ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to
get money to get drunk on&mdash;and loafs around considerable; but
lord, we all do that&mdash;leastways most of us&mdash;preachers and
such like. But he's kind of good&mdash;he give me half a fish,
once, when there warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind
of stood by me when I was out of luck."</p>
<p>"Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to
my line. I wish we could get him out of there."</p>
<p>"My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do
any good; they'd ketch him again."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so
like the dickens when he never done&mdash;that."</p>
<p>"I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking
villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung
before."</p>
<p>"Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that
if he was to get free they'd lynch him."</p>
<p>"And they'd do it, too."</p>
<p>The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As
the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the
neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined
hope that something would happen that might clear away their
difficulties. But nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or
fairies interested in this luckless captive.</p>
<p>The boys did as they had often done before&mdash;went to the
cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on
the ground floor and there were no guards.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img184" id="img184"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="23-184.jpg (108K)" src="images/23-184.jpg" height="944"
width="377" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before&mdash;it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly
and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:</p>
<p>"You've been mighty good to me, boys&mdash;better'n anybody else
in this town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to
myself, says I, 'I used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and
show 'em where the good fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I
could, and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble;
but Tom don't, and Huck don't&mdash;THEY don't forget him, says I,
'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an awful
thing&mdash;drunk and crazy at the time&mdash;that's the only way I
account for it&mdash;and now I got to swing for it, and it's right.
Right, and BEST, too, I reckon&mdash;hope so, anyway. Well, we
won't talk about that. I don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've
befriended me. But what I want to say, is, don't YOU ever get
drunk&mdash;then you won't ever get here. Stand a litter furder
west&mdash;so&mdash;that's it; it's a prime comfort to see faces
that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there
don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces&mdash;good
friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me touch 'em.
That's it. Shake hands&mdash;yourn'll come through the bars, but
mine's too big. Little hands, and weak&mdash;but they've helped
Muff Potter a power, and they'd help him more if they could."</p>
<p>Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of
horrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the
courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but
forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having the same experience.
They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time
to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back
presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the
courtroom, but invariably heard distressing news&mdash;the toils
were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the
end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun
Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the
slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.</p>
<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the
window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours
before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse
the next morning, for this was to be the great day. Both sexes were
about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait
the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter,
pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains
upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him;
no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was
another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff
proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among
the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of
preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.</p>
<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter
washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the
murder was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After
some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them
again when his own counsel said:</p>
<p>"I have no questions to ask him."</p>
<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the
corpse. Counsel for the prosecution said:</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>"I have no questions to ask him," Potter's lawyer replied.</p>
<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's
possession.</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the
audience began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw
away his client's life without an effort?</p>
<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior
when brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave
the stand without being cross-questioned.</p>
<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well
was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were
cross-examined by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and
dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and
provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now
said:</p>
<p>"By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion,
we have fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of
question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case
here."</p>
<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his
hands and rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful
silence reigned in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many
women's compassion testified itself in tears. Counsel for the
defence rose and said:</p>
<p>"Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful
deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible
delirium produced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not
offer that plea." [Then to the clerk:] "Call Thomas Sawyer!"</p>
<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even
excepting Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering
interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The
boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was
administered.</p>

<p>"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about
the hour of midnight?"</p>
<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him.
The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come.
After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength
back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part
of the house hear:</p>
<p>"In the graveyard!"</p>
<p>"A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You
were&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In the graveyard."</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.</p>
<p>"Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Speak up&mdash;just a trifle louder. How near were you?"</p>
<p>"Near as I am to you."</p>
<p>"Were you hidden, or not?"</p>
<p>"I was hid."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave."</p>
<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>
<p>"Any one with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. I went there with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait&mdash;wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your
companion's name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you
carry anything there with you."</p>
<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>
<p>"Speak out, my boy&mdash;don't be diffident. The truth is always
respectable. What did you take there?"</p>
<p>"Only a&mdash;a&mdash;dead cat."</p>
<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>
<p>"We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred&mdash;tell it in your own way&mdash;don't
skip anything, and don't be afraid."</p>
<p>Tom began&mdash;hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his
subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while
every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon
him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his
words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of
the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the
boy said:</p>
<p>"&mdash;and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff
Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window,
tore his way through all opposers, and was gone!</p>

<p>TOM was a glittering hero once more&mdash;the pet of the old,
the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for
the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he
would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.</p>
<p>As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its
bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But
that sort of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not
well to find fault with it.</p>
<p>Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his
nights were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams,
and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could
persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in
the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the
whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the
trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business
might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had saved
him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got
the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that? Since Tom's
harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's house
by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with
the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's confidence in
the human race was wellnigh obliterated.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but
nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.</p>
<p>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured;
the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never
could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had
seen the corpse.</p>
<p>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no
Injun Joe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring
marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook
his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success
which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he
"found a clew." But you can't hang a "clew" for murder, and so
after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just
as insecure as he was before.</p>
<p>The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly
lightened weight of apprehension.</p>

<br />
<p>THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when
he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.
This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find
Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he
had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the
Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and
opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was
always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered
entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome
superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. "Where'll
we dig?" said Huck.</p>
<p>"Oh, most anywhere."</p>
<p>"Why, is it hid all around?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places,
Huck&mdash;sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under
the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls
at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses."</p>
<p>"Who hides it?"</p>
<p>"Why, robbers, of course&mdash;who'd you reckon? Sunday-school
sup'rintendents?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it
and have a good time."</p>
<p>"So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it
and leave it there."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Don't they come after it any more?"</p>
<p>"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks,
or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty;
and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to
find the marks&mdash;a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a
week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics."</p>
<p>"Hyro&mdash;which?"</p>
<p>"Hy'roglyphics&mdash;pictures and things, you know, that don't
seem to mean anything."</p>
<p>"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"</p>
<p>"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted
house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb
sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we
can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up
the Still-House branch, and there's lots of dead-limb
trees&mdash;dead loads of 'em."</p>
<p>"Is it under all of them?"</p>
<p>"How you talk! No!"</p>
<p>"Then how you going to know which one to go for?"</p>
<p>"Go for all of 'em!"</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, it'll take all summer."</p>
<p>"Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred
dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of
di'monds. How's that?"</p>
<p>Huck's eyes glowed.</p>
<p>"That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the
hundred dollars and I don't want no di'monds."</p>
<p>"All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on
di'monds. Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece&mdash;there
ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar."</p>
<p>"No! Is that so?"</p>
<p>"Cert'nly&mdash;anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen
one, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Not as I remember."</p>
<p>"Oh, kings have slathers of them."</p>
<p>"Well, I don' know no kings, Tom."</p>
<p>"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a
raft of 'em hopping around."</p>
<p>"Do they hop?"</p>
<p>"Hop?&mdash;your granny! No!"</p>
<p>"Well, what did you say they did, for?"</p>
<p>"Shucks, I only meant you'd SEE 'em&mdash;not hopping, of
course&mdash;what do they want to hop for?&mdash;but I mean you'd
just see 'em&mdash;scattered around, you know, in a kind of a
general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard."</p>
<p>"Richard? What's his other name?"</p>
<p>"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given
name."</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>"But they don't."</p>
<p>"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a
king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But
say&mdash;where you going to dig first?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img194" id="img194"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="25-194.jpg (56K)" src="images/25-194.jpg" height="484"
width="355" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on
the hill t'other side of Still-House branch?"</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>
<p>So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw
themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have
a smoke.</p>
<p>"I like this," said Tom.</p>
<p>"So do I."</p>
<p>"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do
with your share?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go
to every circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time."</p>
<p>"Well, ain't you going to save any of it?"</p>
<p>"Save it? What for?"</p>
<p>"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by."</p>
<p>"Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town
some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell
you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with
yourn, Tom?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a red
necktie and a bull pup, and get married."</p>
<p>"Married!"</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>"Tom, you&mdash;why, you ain't in your right mind."</p>
<p>"Wait&mdash;you'll see."</p>
<p>"Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and
my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember,
mighty well."</p>
<p>"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't
fight."</p>
<p>"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now
you better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's
the name of the gal?"</p>
<p>"It ain't a gal at all&mdash;it's a girl."</p>
<p>"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says
girl&mdash;both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name,
Tom?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you some time&mdash;not now."</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be
more lonesomer than ever."</p>
<p>"No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of
this and we'll go to digging."</p>
<p>They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled
another halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:</p>
<p>"Do they always bury it as deep as this?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't
got the right place."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img195" id="img195"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="25-195.jpg (52K)" src="images/25-195.jpg" height="514"
width="352" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a
little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence
for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the
beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:</p>
<p>"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"</p>
<p>"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on
Cardiff Hill back of the widow's."</p>
<p>"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it
away from us, Tom? It's on her land."</p>
<p>"SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever
finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make
any difference whose land it's on."</p>
<p>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck
said:</p>
<p>"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you
think?"</p>
<p>"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes
witches interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble
now."</p>
<p>"Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the
matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out
where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where
you dig!"</p>
<p>"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing.
Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful
long way. Can you get out?"</p>
<p>"I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if
somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and
they'll go for it."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll come around and maow tonight."</p>
<p>"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."</p>
<p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They
sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made
solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves,
ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound
floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral
note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked
little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked
where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to
rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace
with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their
hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only
suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At
last Tom said:</p>
<p>"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."</p>
<p>"Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a
dot."</p>
<p>"I know it, but then there's another thing."</p>
<p>"What's that?".</p>
<p>"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late
or too early."</p>
<p>Huck dropped his shovel.</p>
<p>"That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give
this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this
kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and
ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me
all the time; &nbsp;and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe
there's others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all
over, ever since I got here."</p>
<p>"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put
in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out
for it."</p>
<p>"Lordy!"</p>
<p>"Yes, they do. I've always heard that."</p>
<p>"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead
people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."</p>
<p>"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was
to stick his skull out and say something!"</p>
<p>"Don't Tom! It's awful."</p>
<p>"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres
else."</p>
<p>"All right, I reckon we better."</p>
<p>"What'll it be?"</p>
<p>Tom considered awhile; and then said:</p>
<p>"The ha'nted house. That's it!"</p>
<p>"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern
sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they
don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and
peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the
way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that,
Tom&mdash;nobody could."</p>
<p>"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They
won't hender us from digging there in the daytime."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about
that ha'nted house in the day nor the night."</p>
<p>"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's
been murdered, anyway&mdash;but nothing's ever been seen around
that house except in the night&mdash;just some blue lights slipping
by the windows&mdash;no regular ghosts."</p>
<p>"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around,
Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands
to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use
'em."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the
daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?"</p>
<p>"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say
so&mdash;but I reckon it's taking chances."</p>

<br />
<p>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle
of the moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly
isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very
doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant,
a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half
expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a
low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck
far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and
took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward
side of Cardiff Hill.</p>

<p>ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they
had come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted
house; Huck was measurably so, also&mdash;but suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?"</p>
<p>Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly
lifted his eyes with a startled look in them&mdash;</p>
<p>"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that
it was Friday."</p>
<p>"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got
into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."</p>
<p>"MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There's some lucky days, maybe, but
Friday ain't."</p>
<p>"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon YOU was the first that
found it out, Huck."</p>
<p>"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither.
I had a rotten bad dream last night&mdash;dreampt about rats."</p>
<p>"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign
that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look
mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today,
and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No. Who's Robin Hood?"</p>
<p>"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in
England&mdash;and the best. He was a robber."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img200" id="img200"></a><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"</p>
<p>"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such
like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always
divided up with 'em perfectly square."</p>
<p>"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."</p>
<p>"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever
was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any
man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take
his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a
half."</p>
<p>"What's a YEW bow?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit
that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry&mdash;and
curse. But we'll play Robin Hood&mdash;it's nobby fun. I'll learn
you."</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>
<p>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then
casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a
remark about the morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the
sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward
athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from
sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.</p>
<p>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree
again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a
little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because
Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a
treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then
somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust
of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys
shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not
trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that
belong to the business of treasure-hunting.</p>
<p>When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird
and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the
baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and
desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to
venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep.
They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient
fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there,
and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently
entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears
alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for
instant retreat.</p>
<p>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave
the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring
their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to
look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but
they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one
result&mdash;they threw their tools into a corner and made the
ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they
found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a
fraud&mdash;there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and
well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work
when&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sh!" said Tom.</p>
<p>"What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.</p>
<p>"Sh!... There!... Hear it?"</p>
<p>"Yes!... Oh, my! Let's run!"</p>
<p>"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the
door."</p>
<p>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of
fear.</p>
<p>"They've stopped.... No&mdash;coming.... Here they are. Don't
whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of
this!"</p>
<p>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf
and dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice
lately&mdash;never saw t'other man before."</p>
<p>"T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very
pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had
bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his
sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, "t'other"
was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the
door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his
remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct
as he proceeded:</p>
<p>"No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it.
It's dangerous."</p>
<p>"Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard&mdash;to the
vast surprise of the boys. "Milksop!"</p>
<p>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's!
There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:</p>
<p>"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder&mdash;but
nothing's come of it."</p>
<p>"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house
about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we
didn't succeed."</p>
<p>"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the
daytime!&mdash;anybody would suspicion us that saw us."</p>
<p>"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after
that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to
yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with
those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full
view."</p>
<p>"Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this
remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it
was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts
they had waited a year.</p>
<p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long
and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p>
<p>"Look here, lad&mdash;you go back up the river where you belong.
Wait there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping
into this town just once more, for a look. We'll do that
'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think things
look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it together!"</p>
<p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and
Injun Joe said:</p>
<p>"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."</p>
<p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade
stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the
watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men
began to snore now.</p>
<p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Now's our chance&mdash;come!"</p>
<p>Huck said:</p>
<p>"I can't&mdash;I'd die if they was to wake."</p>
<p>Tom urged&mdash;Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and
softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a
hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead
with fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay there
counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must
be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to
note that at last the sun was setting.</p>
<p>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared
around&mdash;smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was
drooping upon his knees&mdash;stirred him up with his foot and
said:</p>
<p>"Here! YOU'RE a watchman, ain't you! All right,
though&mdash;nothing's happened."</p>
<p>"My! have I been asleep?"</p>
<p>"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard.
What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?"</p>
<p>"I don't know&mdash;leave it here as we've always done, I
reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and
fifty in silver's something to carry."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;all right&mdash;it won't matter to come here once
more."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;but I'd say come in the night as we used to
do&mdash;it's better."</p>
<p>"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the
right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a
very good place; we'll just regularly bury it&mdash;and bury it
deep."</p>
<p>"Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt
down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag
that jingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty
dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag
to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging
with his bowie-knife.</p>
<p>The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an
instant. With gloating eyes they watched every movement.
Luck!&mdash;the splendor of it was beyond all imagination! Six
hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich!
Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices&mdash;there
would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They
nudged each other every moment&mdash;eloquent nudges and easily
understood, for they simply meant&mdash;"Oh, but ain't you glad NOW
we're here!"</p>
<p>Joe's knife struck upon something.</p>
<p>"Hello!" said he.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said his comrade.</p>
<p>"Half-rotten plank&mdash;no, it's a box, I believe.
Here&mdash;bear a hand and we'll see what it's here for. Never
mind, I've broke a hole."</p>
<p>He reached his hand in and drew it out&mdash;</p>
<p>"Man, it's money!"</p>
<p>The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The
boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.</p>
<p>Joe's comrade said:</p>
<p>"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over
amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the
fireplace&mdash;I saw it a minute ago."</p>
<p>He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the
pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something
to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed.
It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong
before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the
treasure awhile in blissful silence.</p>
<p>"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe.</p>

<p>"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one
summer," the stranger observed.</p>
<p>"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should
say."</p>
<p>"Now you won't need to do that job."</p>
<p>The halfbreed frowned. Said he:</p>
<p>"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing.
'Tain't robbery altogether&mdash;it's REVENGE!" and a wicked light
flamed in his eyes. "I'll need your help in it. When it's
finished&mdash;then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and
stand by till you hear from me."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;if you say so; what'll we do with this&mdash;bury it
again?"</p>
<p>"Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem, no!
[Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had
fresh earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.]
What business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with
fresh earth on them? Who brought them here&mdash;and where are they
gone? Have you heard anybody?&mdash;seen anybody? What! bury it
again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not
exactly&mdash;not exactly. We'll take it to my den."</p>
<p>"Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean
Number One?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;Number Two&mdash;under the cross. The other place is
bad&mdash;too common."</p>
<p>"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."</p>
<p>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously
peeping out. Presently he said:</p>
<p>"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can
be upstairs?"</p>
<p>The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his
knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the
stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was
gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs&mdash;the intolerable
distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the
lads&mdash;they were about to spring for the closet, when there was
a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid
the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing,
and his comrade said:</p>
<p>"Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up
there, let them STAY there&mdash;who cares? If they want to jump
down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in
fifteen minutes&mdash;and then let them follow us if they want to.
I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here
caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something.
I'll bet they're running yet."</p>

<p>Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what
daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready
for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the
deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious
box.</p>
<p>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after
them through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not
they. They were content to reach ground again without broken necks,
and take the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much.
They were too much absorbed in hating themselves&mdash;hating the
ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. But for
that, Injun Joe never would have suspected. He would have hidden
the silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was
satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that
money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever
brought there!</p>
<p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should
come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and
follow him to "Number Two," wherever that might be. Then a ghastly
thought occurred to Tom.</p>
<p>"Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't!" said Huck, nearly fainting.</p>
<p>They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to
believe that he might possibly mean somebody else&mdash;at least
that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had
testified.</p>
<p>Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger!
Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.</p>

<br />
<p>THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that
night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four
times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him
and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As
he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great
adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far
away&mdash;somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in
a time long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great
adventure itself must be a dream! There was one very strong
argument in favor of this idea&mdash;namely, that the quantity of
coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much
as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of
his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all
references to "hundreds" and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms
of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He
never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred
dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's possession. If
his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have
been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of
vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.</p>
<p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and
clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he
presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing
might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be
swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find
Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly
dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom
concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do it,
then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.</p>
<p>"Hello, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Hello, yourself."</p>
<p>Silence, for a minute.</p>
<p>"Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd
'a' got the money. Oh, ain't it awful!"</p>
<p>"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it
was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck."</p>
<p>"What ain't a dream?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."</p>

<br />
<p>"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much
dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night&mdash;with that
patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em&mdash;rot
him!"</p>
<p>"No, not rot him. FIND him! Track the money!"</p>
<p>"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance
for such a pile&mdash;and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if
I was to see him, anyway."</p>
<p>"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway&mdash;and track
him out&mdash;to his Number Two."</p>
<p>"Number Two&mdash;yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that.
But I can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?"</p>
<p>"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck&mdash;maybe it's the number of
a house!"</p>
<p>"Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this
one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here&mdash;it's the
number of a room&mdash;in a tavern, you know!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find
out quick."</p>
<p>"You stay here, Huck, till I come."</p>
<p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in
public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best
tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was
still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a
mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all
the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it
except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this
state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather
feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself
with the idea that that room was "ha'nted"; had noticed that there
was a light in there the night before.</p>
<p>"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No.
2 we're after."</p>
<p>"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"</p>
<p>"Lemme think."</p>
<p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that
comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the
old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the
doorkeys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first
dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout
for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and
spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see
him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that
ain't the place."</p>
<p>"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!"</p>
<p>"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you&mdash;and
if he did, maybe he'd never think anything."</p>
<p>"Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I
dono&mdash;I dono. I'll try."</p>
<p>"You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a'
found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after
that money."</p>
<p>"It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by
jingoes!"</p>
<p>"Now you're TALKING! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I
won't."</p>

<p>THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They
hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one
watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.
Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard
entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be a fair
one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable
degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and "maow," whereupon
he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear,
and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar
hogshead about twelve.</p>

<br />
<p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But
Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with
his aunt's old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with.
He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An
hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only
ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody
had entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The
blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was
interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.</p>
<p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely
in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the
tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then
there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's
spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from
the lantern&mdash;it would frighten him, but it would at least tell
him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had
disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe
his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness
Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing
all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some
catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath. There was
not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by
thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it
was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
tearing by him: "Run!" said he; "run, for your life!"</p>
<p>He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making
thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.
The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted
slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just as they got
within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As
soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p>
<p>"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I
could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I
couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn
in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I
took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't locked! I
hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;what'd you see, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his
old patch on his eye and his arms spread out."</p>
<p>"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"</p>
<p>"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel
and started!"</p>
<p>"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"</p>
<p>"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost
it."</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"</p>
<p>"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I
didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin
cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more
bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with
that ha'nted room?"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance
Taverns have got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing?
But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun
Joe's drunk."</p>
<p>"It is, that! You try it!"</p>
<p>Huck shuddered.</p>
<p>"Well, no&mdash;I reckon not."</p>
<p>"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe
ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd
do it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know
Injun Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every
night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other,
and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do
it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job."</p>
<p>"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper
Street a block and maow&mdash;and if I'm asleep, you throw some
gravel at the window and that'll fetch me."</p>
<p>"Agreed, and good as wheat!"</p>
<p>"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to
be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long,
will you?"</p>
<p>"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every
night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all
night."</p>
<p>"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?"</p>
<p>"In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's
nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he
wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something
to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He
likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime
I've set right down and eat WITH him. But you needn't tell that. A
body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to
do as a steady thing."</p>
<p>"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I
won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in
the night, just skip right around and maow."</p>

<p>THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
news&mdash;Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night
before. Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary
importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the
boy's interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time
playing "hispy" and "gully-keeper" with a crowd of their
schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly
satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day
for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented.
The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more moderate. The
invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young
folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and
pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing
Huck's "maow," and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the
picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came
that night.</p>
<p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy
and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and
everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly
people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were
considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of
eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts.
The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently
the gay throng filed up the main street laden with
provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary
remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher
said to Becky, was:</p>
<p>"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all
night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing,
child."</p>
<p>"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma."</p>
<p>"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any
trouble."</p>
<p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe
Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow
Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most every
day&mdash;dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have
us."</p>
<p>"Oh, that will be fun!"</p>
<p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p>
<p>"But what will mamma say?"</p>
<p>"How'll she ever know?"</p>
<p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said
reluctantly:</p>
<p>"I reckon it's wrong&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All
she wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go
there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!"</p>
<p>The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It
and Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided
to say nothing anybody about the night's programme. Presently it
occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give
the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his
anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow
Douglas'. And why should he give it up, he reasoned&mdash;the
signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more
likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the
uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the
stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of
money another time that day.</p>
<p>Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a
woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the
forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with
shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and
tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled
back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the
destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a
refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks.
By-and-by somebody shouted:</p>
<p>"Who's ready for the cave?"</p>
<p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway
there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was
up the hillside&mdash;an opening shaped like a letter A. Its
massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber,
chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone
that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to
stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley
shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly
wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was
lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle
and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and
a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession
went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the
flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock
almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main
avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps
other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either
hand&mdash;for McDougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked
aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It
was said that one might wander days and nights together through its
intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the
cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the
earth, and it was just the same&mdash;labyrinth under labyrinth,
and no end to any of them. No man "knew" the cave. That was an
impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and
it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom
Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters
of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into
branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other
by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties
were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without
going beyond the "known" ground.</p>
<p>By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the
mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot
with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted
with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find that
they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at
hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However,
this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and
therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her wild freight
pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time
but the captain of the craft.</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went
glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are
nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she
did not stop at the wharf&mdash;and then he dropped her out of his
mind and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing
cloudy and dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles
ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling
foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its
slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the
ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were put out;
darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any
use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?</p>
<p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant.
The alley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick
store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to
have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were
going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be
absurd&mdash;the men would get away with the box and never be found
again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would
trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing
with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men,
cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
ahead not to be invisible.</p>
<p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the
left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they
came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They
passed by the old Welshman's house, halfway up the hill, without
hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will
bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry.
They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path
between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the
gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they
would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then
slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a
piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an
owl came over the hill&mdash;ominous sound! But no footsteps.
Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged
feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's
heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he
stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at
once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the
ground. He knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of
the stile leading into Widow Douglas' grounds. Very well, he
thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard to find.</p>
<p>Now there was a voice&mdash;a very low voice&mdash;Injun
Joe's:</p>
<p>"Damn her, maybe she's got company&mdash;there's lights, late as
it is."</p>
<p>"I can't see any."</p>
<p>This was that stranger's voice&mdash;the stranger of the haunted
house. A deadly chill went to Huck's heart&mdash;this, then, was
the "revenge" job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that
the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe
these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to
warn her; but he knew he didn't dare&mdash;they might come and
catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed
between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's next&mdash;which
was&mdash;</p>
<p>"Because the bush is in your way. Now&mdash;this way&mdash;now
you see, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, there IS company there, I reckon. Better give it
up."</p>
<p>"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up
and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told
you before, I don't care for her swag&mdash;you may have it. But
her husband was rough on me&mdash;many times he was rough on
me&mdash;and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me
for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth part of it!
He had me HORSEWHIPPED!&mdash;horsewhipped in front of the jail,
like a nigger!&mdash;with all the town looking on!
HORSEWHIPPED!&mdash;do you understand? He took advantage of me and
died. But I'll take it out of HER."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!"</p>
<p>"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill HIM if he
was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you
don't kill her&mdash;bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her
nostrils&mdash;you notch her ears like a sow!"</p>
<p>"By God, that's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll
tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll
not cry, if she does. My friend, you'll help me in this
thing&mdash;for MY sake&mdash;that's why you're here&mdash;I
mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you. Do you
understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her&mdash;and
then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this
business."</p>
<p>"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the
better&mdash;I'm all in a shiver."</p>
<p>"Do it NOW? And company there? Look here&mdash;I'll get
suspicious of you, first thing you know. No&mdash;we'll wait till
the lights are out&mdash;there's no hurry."</p>
<p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue&mdash;a thing still
more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath
and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly,
after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost
toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took
another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks;
then another and another, and&mdash;a twig snapped under his foot!
His breath stopped and he listened. There was no sound&mdash;the
stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned
in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes&mdash;turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship&mdash;and then stepped
quickly but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt
secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down
he sped, till he reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and
presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were
thrust from windows.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Let me in&mdash;quick! I'll tell everything."</p>
<p>"Why, who are you?"</p>
<p>"Huckleberry Finn&mdash;quick, let me in!"</p>
<p>"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I
judge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble."</p>
<p>"Please don't ever tell I told you," were Huck's first words
when he got in. "Please don't&mdash;I'd be killed, sure&mdash;but
the widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to
tell&mdash;I WILL tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was
me."</p>
<p>"By George, he HAS got something to tell, or he wouldn't act
so!" exclaimed the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever
tell, lad."</p>
<p>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were
up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their
weapons in their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid
behind a great bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging,
anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of
firearms and a cry.</p>
<p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the
hill as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning,
Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old
Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that
was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of
the night. A call came from a window:</p>
<p>"Who's there!"</p>
<p>Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:</p>
<p>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"</p>
<p>"It's a name that can open this door night or day,
lad!&mdash;and welcome!"</p>
<p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the
pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the
closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was
quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old
man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.</p>
<p>"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast
will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot
one, too&mdash;make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped
you'd turn up and stop here last night."</p>
<p>"I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the
pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now
becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before
daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils, even if
they was dead."</p>
<p>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of
it&mdash;but there's a bed here for you when you've had your
breakfast. No, they ain't dead, lad&mdash;we are sorry enough for
that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your
description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen
feet of them&mdash;dark as a cellar that sumach path was&mdash;and
just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of
luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use&mdash;'twas bound to
come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and
when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of
the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place
where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a
jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I
judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they
started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As
soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went
down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and
went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the
sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be
with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of
those rascals&mdash;'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see
what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img227" id="img227"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="30-227.jpg (48K)" src="images/30-227.jpg" height="488"
width="356" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them."</p>
<p>"Splendid! Describe them&mdash;describe them, my boy!"</p>
<p>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here
once or twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the
woods back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with
you, boys, and tell the sheriff&mdash;get your breakfast tomorrow
morning!"</p>
<p>The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the
room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them!
Oh, please!"</p>
<p>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit
of what you did."</p>
<p>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"</p>
<p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p>
<p>"They won't tell&mdash;and I won't. But why don't you want it
known?"</p>
<p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew
too much about one of those men and would not have the man know
that he knew anything against him for the whole world&mdash;he
would be killed for knowing it, sure.</p>
<p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p>
<p>"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they
looking suspicious?"</p>
<p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he
said:</p>
<p>"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,&mdash;least everybody
says so, and I don't see nothing agin it&mdash;and sometimes I
can't sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of
trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it
last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along upstreet 'bout
midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly
brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to
have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps
slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I
reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one wanted
a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb
Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and
t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil."</p>
<p>"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"</p>
<p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img229" id="img229"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="30-229.jpg (55K)" src="images/30-229.jpg" height="508"
width="344" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;but somehow it seems as if I did."</p>
<p>"Then they went on, and you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Follered 'em&mdash;yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was
up&mdash;they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile,
and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder,
and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and
your two&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!"</p>
<p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best
to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the
Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him
into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts
to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon him and
he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:</p>
<p>"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your
head for all the world. No&mdash;I'd protect you&mdash;I'd protect
you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip
without intending it; you can't cover that up now. You know
something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust
me&mdash;tell me what it is, and trust me&mdash;I won't betray
you."</p>
<p>Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent
over and whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>"'Tain't a Spaniard&mdash;it's Injun Joe!"</p>
<p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he
said:</p>
<p>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears
and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment,
because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun!
That's a different matter altogether."</p>
<p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the
old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done,
before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and
its vicinity for marks of blood. They found none, but captured a
bulky bundle of&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of WHAT?"</p>
<p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with
a more stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were
staring wide, now, and his breath suspended&mdash;waiting for the
answer. The Welshman started&mdash;stared in return&mdash;three
seconds&mdash;five seconds&mdash;ten&mdash;then replied:</p>
<p>"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?"</p>
<p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably
grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously&mdash;and
presently said:</p>
<p>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal.
But what did give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd
found?"</p>
<p>Huck was in a close place&mdash;the inquiring eye was upon
him&mdash;he would have given anything for material for a plausible
answer&mdash;nothing suggested itself&mdash;the inquiring eye was
boring deeper and deeper&mdash;a senseless reply
offered&mdash;there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he
uttered it&mdash;feebly:</p>
<p>"Sunday-school books, maybe."</p>
<p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed
loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to
foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's
pocket, because it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then
he added:</p>
<p>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded&mdash;you ain't well a
bit&mdash;no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance.
But you'll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all
right, I hope."</p>
<p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and
betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea
that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon
as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile. He had only thought
it was not the treasure, however&mdash;he had not known that it
wasn't&mdash;and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too
much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the
little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question
that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so his mind was at rest
and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be
still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and
he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or
any fear of interruption.</p>
<p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door.
Huck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected
even remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several
ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed
that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill&mdash;to stare at
the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the
story of the night to the visitors. The widow's gratitude for her
preservation was outspoken.</p>
<p>"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're
more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he
don't allow me to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but
for him."</p>
<p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost
belittled the main matter&mdash;but the Welshman allowed it to eat
into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to
the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all
else had been learned, the widow said:</p>
<p>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all
that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?"</p>
<p>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to
come again&mdash;they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what
was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three
negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night.
They've just come back."</p>
<p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for
a couple of hours more.</p>
<p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but
everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well
canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been
yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife
dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with
the crowd and said:</p>
<p>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would
be tired to death."</p>
<p>"Your Becky?"</p>
<p>"Yes," with a startled look&mdash;"didn't she stay with you last
night?"</p>
<br />
<br />

width="362" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Why, no."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt
Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly
said:</p>
<p>"Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got
a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your
house last night&mdash;one of you. And now he's afraid to come to
church. I've got to settle with him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than
ever.</p>
<p>"He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look
uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.</p>
<p>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"</p>
<p>"No'm."</p>
<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>
<p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people
had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a
boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children
were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they
had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat
on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if
any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear
that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt
Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.</p>
<p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from
street to street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly
clanging and the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank
into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses
were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and
before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were
pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.</p>

width="679" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many
women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort
them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than
words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the
morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, "Send more
candles&mdash;and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and
Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and
encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.</p>
<p>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found
Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious
with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow
Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do
her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent,
he was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to
be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the
widow said:</p>
<p>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it
off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes
from his hands."</p>
<p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle
into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued
searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses
of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited
before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly
searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,
lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance,
and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to
the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section
usually traversed by tourists, the names "BECKY &amp; TOM" had been
found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at
hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should
ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could
ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living
body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in
the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a
glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping
down the echoing aisle&mdash;and then a sickening disappointment
always followed; the children were not there; it was only a
searcher's light.</p>

<br />
<p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours
along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had
heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that the
proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises,
scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In
a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and
finally asked&mdash;dimly dreading the worst&mdash;if anything had
been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the widow.</p>
<p>Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:</p>
<p>"What? What was it?"</p>
<p>"Liquor!&mdash;and the place has been shut up. Lie down,
child&mdash;what a turn you did give me!"</p>
<p>"Only tell me just one thing&mdash;only just one&mdash;please!
Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?"</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told
you before, you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!"</p>
<p>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a
great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone
forever&mdash;gone forever! But what could she be crying about?
Curious that she should cry.</p>
<p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and
under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to
herself:</p>
<p>"There&mdash;he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity
but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now,
that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on
searching."</p>

<br />
<p>NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They
tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company,
visiting the familiar wonders of the cave&mdash;wonders dubbed with
rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The
Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. Presently the
hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it
with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then
they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and
reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses,
and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in
candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely
noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were
not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging
shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little
stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone
sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced
and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom
squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for
Becky's gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep
natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at
once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img237" id="img237"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="31-237.jpg (66K)" src="images/31-237.jpg" height="658"
width="361" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for
future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way
and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another
mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper
world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose
ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length
and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it,
wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the
numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to
a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of
glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls
were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by
the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the
result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof
vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a
bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking
down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.
Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He
seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that
offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with
its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased
the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every
new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous
things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its
dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted
to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit
down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep
stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
children. Becky said:</p>
<p>"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard
any of the others."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img238" id="img238"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="31-238.jpg (106K)" src="images/31-238.jpg" height="649"
width="636" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them&mdash;and I
don't know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it
is. We couldn't hear them here."</p>
<p>Becky grew apprehensive.</p>
<p>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start
back."</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."</p>
<p>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to
me."</p>
<p>"I reckon I could find it&mdash;but then the bats. If they put
our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way,
so as not to go through there."</p>
<p>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and
the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful
possibilities.</p>
<p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a
long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was
anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange.
Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for
an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it
right away!"</p>
<p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and
presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random,
in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said
it was "all right," but there was such a leaden dread at his heart
that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had
said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear,
and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last
she said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem
to get worse and worse off all the time."</p>
<p>"Listen!" said he.</p>
<p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings
were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing
down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound
that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky.</p>
<p>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you
know," and he shouted again.</p>
<p>The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly
laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood
still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the
back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little
while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another
fearful fact to Becky&mdash;he could not find his way back!</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"</p>
<p>"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might
want to come back! No&mdash;I can't find the way. It's all mixed
up."</p>
<p>"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this
awful place! Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img240" id="img240"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="31-240.jpg (50K)" src="images/31-240.jpg" height="495"
width="363" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying
that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her
reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried
her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her
terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all
to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she
said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for
getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better
effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and
follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that
any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.</p>
<p>So they moved on again&mdash;aimlessly&mdash;simply at
random&mdash;all they could do was to move, keep moving. For a
little while, hope made a show of reviving&mdash;not with any
reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when
the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with
failure.</p>
<p>By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy
meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her
hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or
four pieces in his pockets&mdash;yet he must economize.</p>
<p>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children
tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting
down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some
direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear
fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its
pursuit.</p>
<p>At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She
sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the
friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!
Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her,
but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and
sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she
drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her
drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence
of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there.
The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his
own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up
with a breezy little laugh&mdash;but it was stricken dead upon her
lips, and a groan followed it.</p>
<p>"Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No,
I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and
we'll find the way out."</p>
<p>"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my
dream. I reckon we are going there."</p>
<p>"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on
trying."</p>
<p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They
tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they
knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that
this could not be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time
after this&mdash;they could not tell how long&mdash;Tom said they
must go softly and listen for dripping water&mdash;they must find a
spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest
again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she
could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent.
She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his
candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was
soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
silence:</p>
<p>"Tom, I am so hungry!"</p>
<p>Tom took something out of his pocket.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img242" id="img242"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="31-242.jpg (57K)" src="images/31-242.jpg" height="496"
width="354" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Do you remember this?" said he.</p>
<p>Becky almost smiled.</p>
<p>"It's our wedding-cake, Tom."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've
got."</p>
<p>"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way
grownup people do with wedding-cake&mdash;but it'll be
our&mdash;"</p>
<p>She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and
Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety.
There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with.
By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a
moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"</p>
<p>Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.</p>
<p>"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to
drink. That little piece is our last candle!"</p>
<p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to
comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:</p>
<p>"Tom!"</p>
<p>"Well, Becky?"</p>
<p>"They'll miss us and hunt for us!"</p>
<p>"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!"</p>
<p>"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."</p>
<p>"Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are."</p>
<p>"When would they miss us, Tom?"</p>
<p>"When they get back to the boat, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Tom, it might be dark then&mdash;would they notice we hadn't
come?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as
they got home."</p>
<p>A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and
he saw that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home
that night! The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment
a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his
mind had struck hers also&mdash;that the Sabbath morning might be
half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at
Mrs. Harper's.</p>
<p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and
watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of
wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb
the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and
then&mdash;the horror of utter darkness reigned!</p>
<p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow
consciousness that she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could
tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty
stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and
resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday,
now&mdash;maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her
sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that
they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was
going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried
it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously
that he tried it no more.</p>
<p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives
again. A portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided
and ate it. But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel
of food only whetted desire.</p>
<p>By-and-by Tom said:</p>
<p>"SH! Did you hear that?"</p>
<p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading
Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its
direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard,
and apparently a little nearer.</p>
<p>"It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along,
Becky&mdash;we're all right now!"</p>
<p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed
was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had
to be guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It
might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred&mdash;there was no
passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as
far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait
until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant
shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they
had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped
until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to
Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came
again.</p>
<p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time
dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.
Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.</p>
<p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at
hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the
weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his
pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in
the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end of
twenty steps the corridor ended in a "jumping-off place." Tom got
down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner
as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to
stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not
twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from
behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that
hand was followed by the body it belonged to&mdash;Injun Joe's! Tom
was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next
moment, to see the "Spaniard" take to his heels and get himself out
of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and
come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes
must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he
reasoned. Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said
to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring
he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk
of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what
it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted "for luck."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long
run. Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep
brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger.
Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday
or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over. He
proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun
Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk
into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She said she would
wait, now, where she was, and die&mdash;it would not be long. She
told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she
implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and
she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay
by her and hold her hand until all was over.</p>
<p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made
a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape
from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went
groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed
with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.</p>

<br />
<p>TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village
of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been
found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and
many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it;
but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the
searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily
avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be
found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time
delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her
child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then
lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into
a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The
village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.</p>
<p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the
village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with
frantic half-clad people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're
found! they're found!" Tin pans and horns were added to the din,
the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the
children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens,
thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept
magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was
the greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first
half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's
house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs.
Thatcher's hand, tried to speak but couldn't&mdash;and drifted out
raining tears all over the place.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly
so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger
dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to
her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him
and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many
striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a
description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring
expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line
would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the
kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward
it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the
broad Mississippi rolling by!</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img249" id="img249"></a><br />
<br />
<center><img alt="32-249.jpg (97K)" src="images/32-249.jpg" height=
"520" width="705" /></center>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen
that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any
more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news
and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was
tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described
how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died
for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue
speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then
helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some
men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their
situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't believe
the wild tale at first, "because," said they, "you are five miles
down the river below the valley the cave is in"&mdash;then took
them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest
till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.</p>
<p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers
with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had
strung behind them, and informed of the great news.</p>
<p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more
and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on
Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever
Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then
she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.</p>
<p>Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday,
but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on
Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was
warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting
topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home
Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the "ragged man's"
body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing;
he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.</p>
<p>About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started
off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear
exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he
thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to
see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some
one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave
again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:</p>
<p>"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least
doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that
cave any more."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks
ago, and triple-locked&mdash;and I've got the keys."</p>
<p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of
water!"</p>
<p>The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.</p>
<p>"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you,
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"</p>

<br />
<p>WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen
skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the
ferryboat, well filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer
was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.</p>
<p>When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented
itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched
upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the
door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment,
upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was
touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had
suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding
sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a
degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight
of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice
against this bloody-minded outcast.</p>
<br />

<a name="img253" id="img253"></a><br />
<br />
<center><img alt="33-253.jpg (90K)" src="images/33-253.jpg" height=

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two.
The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked
through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the
native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn
material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was
to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction
there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had
been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body
under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in
order to be doing something&mdash;in order to pass the weary
time&mdash;in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily
one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the
crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were
none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had
also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten,
leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to
death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly
growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from
a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite,
and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a
shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every
three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick&mdash;a
dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was
falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the
foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the
Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when
the massacre at Lexington was "news."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these
things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the
twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of
oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop
fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this
flitting human insect's need? and has it another important object
to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and
many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to
catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares
longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he
comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands
first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace"
cannot rival it.</p>
<p>Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people
flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the
farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their
children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had
had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have
had at the hanging.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing&mdash;the
petition to the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had
been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been
held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep
mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a
merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was
believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of
that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of
weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and
drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky
water-works.</p>
<p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place
to have an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's
adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time,
but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him;
that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. Huck's face
saddened. He said:</p>
<p>"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything
but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must
'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I
knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way
or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom,
something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag."</p>
<p>"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his
tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you
remember you was to watch there that night?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night
that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's."</p>
<p>"YOU followed him?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends
behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean
tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all
right."</p>
<p>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who
had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.</p>
<p>"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I
reckon&mdash;anyways it's a goner for us, Tom."</p>
<p>"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"</p>
<p>"What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you
got on the track of that money again?"</p>
<p>"Huck, it's in the cave!"</p>
<p>Huck's eyes blazed.</p>
<p>"Say it again, Tom."</p>
<p>"The money's in the cave!"</p>
<p>"Tom&mdash;honest injun, now&mdash;is it fun, or earnest?"</p>
<p>"Earnest, Huck&mdash;just as earnest as ever I was in my life.
Will you go in there with me and help get it out?"</p>
<p>"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it
and not get lost."</p>
<p>"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in
the world."</p>
<p>"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it
I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the
world. I will, by jings."</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;it's a whiz. When do you say?"</p>
<p>"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"</p>
<p>"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four
days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom&mdash;least I don't
think I could."</p>
<p>"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would
go, Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody
but me know about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll
float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by
myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over."</p>
<p>"Less start right off, Tom."</p>
<p>"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a
little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these
new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's
the time I wished I had some when I was in there before."</p>
<p>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a
citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were
several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said:</p>
<p>"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down
from the cave hollow&mdash;no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all
alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been
a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore,
now."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>They landed.</p>
<p>"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I
got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."</p>
<p>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom
proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:</p>
<p>"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this
country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to
be a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and
where to run across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll
keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers
in&mdash;because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there
wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang&mdash;it sounds
splendid, don't it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"</p>
<p>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people&mdash;that's mostly the
way."</p>
<p>"And kill them?"</p>
<p>"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a
ransom."</p>
<p>"What's a ransom?"</p>
<p>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends;
and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill
them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You
shut up the women, but you don't kill them. They're always
beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and
things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They
ain't anybody as polite as robbers&mdash;you'll see that in any
book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in
the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you
couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right
around and come back. It's so in all the books."</p>
<p>"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a
pirate."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and
circuses and all that."</p>
<p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole,
Tom in the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the
tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A
few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver
all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched
on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky
had watched the flame struggle and expire.</p>
<p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness
and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and
presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they
reached the "jumping-off place." The candles revealed the fact that
it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or
thirty feet high. Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Now I'll show you something, Huck."</p>
<p>He held his candle aloft and said:</p>
<p>"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that?
There&mdash;on the big rock over yonder&mdash;done with
candle-smoke."</p>
<p>"Tom, it's a CROSS!"</p>
<p>"NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right
yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"</p>
<p>Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a
shaky voice:</p>
<p>"Tom, less git out of here!"</p>
<p>"What! and leave the treasure?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there,
certain."</p>
<p>"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where
he died&mdash;away out at the mouth of the cave&mdash;five mile
from here."</p>
<p>"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the
ways of ghosts, and so do you."</p>
<p>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in
his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun
Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a
cross!"</p>
<p>The point was well taken. It had its effect.</p>
<p>"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us,
that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for
that box."</p>
<p>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he
descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small
cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of
them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest
the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it;
also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones
of two or three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads searched
and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:</p>
<p>"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being
under the cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that
sets solid on the ground."</p>
<p>They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down
discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on
the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides.
Now, what's that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm
going to dig in the clay."</p>
<p>"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation.</p>
<p>Tom's "real Barlow" was out at once, and he had not dug four
inches before he struck wood.</p>
<p>"Hey, Huck!&mdash;you hear that?"</p>
<p>Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon
uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led
under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under
the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the
rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the
narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course,
first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned
a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"</p>
<p>It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little
cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather
cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and
some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.</p>
<p>"Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins
with his hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to
believe, but we HAVE got it, sure! Say&mdash;let's not fool around
here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box."</p>
<p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an
awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.</p>
<p>"I thought so," he said; "THEY carried it like it was heavy,
that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right
to think of fetching the little bags along."</p>
<p>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the
cross rock.</p>
<p>"Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.</p>
<p>"No, Huck&mdash;leave them there. They're just the tricks to
have when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and
we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for
orgies."</p>
<p>"What orgies?"</p>
<p>"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got
to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long
time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and
smoke when we get to the skiff."</p>
<p>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked
warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and
smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they
pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the
long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly
after dark.</p>
<p>"Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the
widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count
it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for
it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the
stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be
gone a minute."</p>
<p>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the
two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and
started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached
the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about
to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:</p>
<p>"Hallo, who's that?"</p>
<p>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody
waiting. Here&mdash;hurry up, trot ahead&mdash;I'll haul the wagon
for you. Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in
it?&mdash;or old metal?"</p>
<p>"Old metal," said Tom.</p>
<p>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and
fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell
to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular
work. But that's human nature&mdash;hurry along, hurry along!"</p>
<p>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.</p>
<p>"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'."</p>
<p>Huck said with some apprehension&mdash;for he was long used to
being falsely accused:</p>
<p>"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing."</p>
<p>The Welshman laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that.
Ain't you and the widow good friends?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway."</p>
<p>"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"</p>
<p>This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind
before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas'
drawing-room. Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and
followed.</p>
<p>The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any
consequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the
Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the
editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The
widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive
two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and
candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and
frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as
the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:</p>
<p>"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on
him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in
a hurry."</p>
<p>"And you did just right," said the widow. "Come with me,
boys."</p>
<p>She took them to a bedchamber and said:</p>
<p>"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
clothes&mdash;shirts, socks, everything complete. They're
Huck's&mdash;no, no thanks, Huck&mdash;Mr. Jones bought one and I
the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into them. We'll
wait&mdash;come down when you are slicked up enough."</p>
<p>Then she left.</p>

<p>HUCK said: "Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window
ain't high from the ground."</p>
<p>"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?"</p>
<p>"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I
ain't going down there, Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take
care of you."</p>
<p>Sid appeared.</p>
<p>"Tom," said he, "auntie has been waiting for you all the
afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been
fretting about you. Say&mdash;ain't this grease and clay, on your
clothes?"</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all
this blowout about, anyway?"</p>
<p>"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This
time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape
they helped her out of the other night. And say&mdash;I can tell
you something, if you want to know."</p>
<p>"Well, what?"</p>
<p>"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the
people here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about
it, as a secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now.
Everybody knows&mdash;the widow, too, for all she tries to let on
she don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here&mdash;couldn't
get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!"</p>
<p>"Secret about what, Sid?"</p>
<p>"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr.
Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet
you it will drop pretty flat."</p>
<p>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.</p>
<p>"Sid, was it you that told?"</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told&mdash;that's
enough."</p>
<p>"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do
that, and that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a'
sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You
can't do any but mean things, and you can't bear to see anybody
praised for doing good ones. There&mdash;no thanks, as the widow
says"&mdash;and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door
with several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare&mdash;and
tomorrow you'll catch it!"</p>
<p>Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table,
and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the
same room, after the fashion of that country and that day. At the
proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked
the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but
said that there was another person whose modesty&mdash;</p>
<p>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share
in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of,
but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as
clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier
circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair show of
astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude
upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort
of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being
set up as a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's
laudations.</p>
<p>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and
have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she
would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come.
He said:</p>
<p>"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."</p>
<p>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company
kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant
joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:</p>
<p>"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots
of it. Oh, you needn't smile&mdash;I reckon I can show you. You
just wait a minute."</p>
<p>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a
perplexed interest&mdash;and inquiringly at Huck, who was
tongue-tied.</p>
<p>"Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He&mdash;well, there
ain't ever any making of that boy out. I never&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt
Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow
coin upon the table and said:</p>
<p>"There&mdash;what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half
of it's mine!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody
spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an
explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was
long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an interruption
from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had finished,
Mr. Jones said:</p>
<p>"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion,
but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty
small, I'm willing to allow."</p>
<p>The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve
thousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at
one time before, though several persons were there who were worth
considerably more than that in property.</p>

<br />
<p>THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall
made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So
vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was
talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of
the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.
Every "haunted" house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring
villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up
and ransacked for hidden treasure&mdash;and not by boys, but
men&mdash;pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever
Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at. The
boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed
weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated;
everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable;
they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace
things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to
bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper published
biographical sketches of the boys.</p>
<p>The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and
Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request.
Each lad had an income, now, that was simply prodigious&mdash;a
dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays. It
was just what the minister got&mdash;no, it was what he was
promised&mdash;he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar and a
quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days&mdash;and clothe him and wash him, too, for that
matter.</p>
<p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said
that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the
cave. When Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had
taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when
she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to
shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said
with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous
lie&mdash;a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down
through history breast to breast with George Washington's lauded
Truth about the hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked
so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his
foot and said that. She went straight off and told Tom about
it.</p>
<p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great
soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be
admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in
the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready
for either career or both.</p>
<p>Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow
Douglas' protection introduced him into society&mdash;no, dragged
him into it, hurled him into it&mdash;and his sufferings were
almost more than he could bear. The widow's servants kept him clean
and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in
unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he
could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with
a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to
learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly
that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he
turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound
him hand and foot.</p>
<p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day
turned up missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him
everywhere in great distress. The public were profoundly concerned;
they searched high and low, they dragged the river for his body.
Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some
old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and
in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had
just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was
lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was unkempt,
uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him
picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him
out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go
home. Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy
cast. He said:</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it
don't work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's
good to me, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me
get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they
comb me all to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I
got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they
don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow; and they're so
rotten nice that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll around
anywher's; I hain't slid on a cellar-door for&mdash;well, it 'pears
to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat&mdash;I hate
them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I
got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes
to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell&mdash;everything's so awful
reg'lar a body can't stand it."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="img271" id="img271"></a><br />
<br />
<center><img alt="35-271.jpg (112K)" src="images/35-271.jpg"
height="562" width="601" /></center>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Well, everybody does that way, Huck."</p>
<p>"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I
can't STAND it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too
easy&mdash;I don't take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to
ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming&mdash;dern'd
if I hain't got to ask to do everything. Well, I'd got to talk so
nice it wasn't no comfort&mdash;I'd got to go up in the attic and
rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I'd a
died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she wouldn't let me
yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before
folks&mdash;" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
injury]&mdash;"And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never
see such a woman! I HAD to shove, Tom&mdash;I just had to. And
besides, that school's going to open, and I'd a had to go to
it&mdash;well, I wouldn't stand THAT, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being
rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's just worry and worry,
and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now
these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and I ain't ever
going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into all this
trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take my
sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center
sometimes&mdash;not many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a
thing 'thout it's tollable hard to git&mdash;and you go and beg off
for me with the widder."</p>
<p>"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides
if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like
it."</p>
<p>"Like it! Yes&mdash;the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set
on it long enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in
them cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and
hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd
got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern
foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!"</p>
<p>Tom saw his opportunity&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from
turning robber."</p>
<p>"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest,
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't
let you into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know."</p>
<p>Huck's joy was quenched.</p>
<p>"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than
what a pirate is&mdash;as a general thing. In most countries
they're awful high up in the nobility&mdash;dukes and such."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't
shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, WOULD you,
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I DON'T want to&mdash;but what
would people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty
low characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like
that, and I wouldn't."</p>
<p>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle.
Finally he said:</p>
<p>"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and
see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang,
Tom."</p>
<p>"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll
ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck."</p>
<p>"Will you, Tom&mdash;now will you? That's good. If she'll let up
on some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss
private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the
gang and turn robbers?"</p>
<p>"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the
initiation tonight, maybe."</p>
<p>"Have the which?"</p>
<p>"Have the initiation."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the
gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill
anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang."</p>
<p>"That's gay&mdash;that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."</p>
<p>"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at
midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find&mdash;a
ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now."</p>
<p>"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."</p>
<p>"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it
with blood."</p>
<p>"Now, that's something LIKE! Why, it's a million times bullier
than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I
git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout
it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY,
it must stop here; the story could not go much further without
becoming the history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown
people, he knows exactly where to stop&mdash;that is, with a
marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he
best can.</p>
<p>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and
are prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take
up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and
women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to
reveal any of that part of their lives at present.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
