<p><span class="first-word">The</span> sun rose upon a tranquil world, and
beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt
Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of
solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the
Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.</p>

<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to &ldquo;get his
verses.&rdquo; Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies
to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount,
because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour
Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was
traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with
distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to
find his way through the fog:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed are the &ndash; a &ndash; a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes &ndash; poor; blessed are the poor &ndash; a &ndash;
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spirit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they &ndash;
they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Theirs</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For <em>theirs</em>. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
<em>theirs</em> is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they
&ndash; they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For they &ndash; a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S, H, A&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For they S, H&mdash; Oh, I don&#8217;t know what it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Shall!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>shall</em>! for they shall &ndash; for they shall &ndash; a
&ndash; a &ndash; shall mourn &ndash; a &ndash; a &ndash; blessed are they that
shall &ndash; they that &ndash; a &ndash; they that shall mourn, for they shall
&ndash; a &ndash; shall <em>what</em>? Why don&#8217;t you tell me, Mary?
&ndash; what do you want to be so mean for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I&#8217;m not teasing you. I
wouldn&#8217;t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don&#8217;t you be
discouraged, Tom, you&#8217;ll manage it &ndash; and if you do, I&#8217;ll give
you something ever so nice. There, now, that&#8217;s a good boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it&#8217;s nice, it is
nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet you that&#8217;s so, Mary. All right, I&#8217;ll tackle it
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he did &ldquo;tackle it again&rdquo; &ndash; and under the double
pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new &ldquo;Barlow&rdquo;
knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept
his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,
but it was a &ldquo;sure-enough&rdquo; Barlow, and there was inconceivable
grandeur in that &ndash; though where the Western boys ever got the idea that
such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called
off to dress for Sunday-school.</p>

<div id="ill-22" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-022.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>USING THE &ldquo;BARLOW.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside
the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in
the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the
ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face
diligently on the towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now ain&#8217;t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn&#8217;t be so bad. Water
won&#8217;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood
over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began.
When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the
towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from
his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for
the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below
and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread
downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when
she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color,
and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a
dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls,
with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he
held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then
Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during
two years &ndash; they were simply called his &ldquo;other clothes&rdquo;
&ndash; and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl &ldquo;put him
to rights&rdquo; after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout
up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed
him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly
improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for
there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated
them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost
his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn&#8217;t
want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Tom &ndash; that&#8217;s a good boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school &ndash; a place that Tom hated with his whole
heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.</p>

<div id="ill-23" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-023.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>THE CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the
other always remained too &ndash; for stronger reasons. The church&#8217;s
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the
edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top
of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a
Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;ll you take for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;ll you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less see &#8217;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then
Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle
or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went
on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered
the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to
his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher,
a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy&#8217;s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say
&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom&#8217;s whole
class were of a pattern &ndash; restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to
be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward
&ndash; in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue
ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red
one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for
ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth
forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have
the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dor√©
Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way &ndash; it was the
patient work of two years &ndash; and a boy of German parentage had won four or
five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain
upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth &ndash; a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always
made this boy come out and &ldquo;spread himself.&rdquo; Only the older pupils
managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get
a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day
that on the spot every scholar&#8217;s heart was fired with a fresh ambition
that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom&#8217;s mental
stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably
his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came
with it.</p>

<div id="ill-24" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-024.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>NECESSITIES.</p>
</div>

<p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a
closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and
commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary
little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable
sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and
sings a solo at a concert &ndash; though why, is a mystery: for neither the
hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This
superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short
sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his
ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth
&ndash; a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading
cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his
boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners
&ndash; an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting
with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very
earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things
and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There &ndash; that
is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little
girl who is looking out of the window &ndash; I am afraid she thinks I am out
there somewhere &ndash; perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the
little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel
to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this,
learning to do right and be good.&rdquo; And so forth and so on. It is not
necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does
not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.</p>

<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and
other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and
whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated
and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly,
with the subsidence of Mr. Walters&#8217;s voice, and the conclusion of the
speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.</p>

<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more
or less rare &ndash; the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a
very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray
hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter&#8217;s wife. The lady
was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings;
conscience-smitten, too &ndash; he could not meet Amy Lawrence&#8217;s eye, he
could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small new-comer his soul
was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was &ldquo;showing
off&rdquo; with all his might &ndash; cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces
&ndash; in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and
win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy &ndash; the memory of his
humiliation in this angel&#8217;s garden &ndash; and that record in sand was
fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it
now.</p>

<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
Walters&#8217;s speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage &ndash; no less a one
than the county judge &ndash; altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon &ndash; and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of &ndash; and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away &ndash; so he had travelled,
and seen the world &ndash; these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house &ndash; which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of
staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer.
Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be
envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the
whisperings:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him, Jim! He&#8217;s a-going up there. Say &ndash; look!
he&#8217;s a-going to shake hands with him &ndash; he <em>is</em> shaking hands
with him! By jings, don&#8217;t you wish you was Jeff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Walters fell to &ldquo;showing off,&rdquo; with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian
&ldquo;showed off&rdquo; &ndash; running hither and thither with his arms full
of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in. The young lady teachers &ldquo;showed off&rdquo; &ndash; bending
sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers
&ldquo;showed off&rdquo; with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to discipline &ndash; and most of the teachers, of
both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business
that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming
vexation). The little girls &ldquo;showed off&rdquo; in various ways, and the
little boys &ldquo;showed off&rdquo; with such diligence that the air was thick
with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat
and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in
the sun of his own grandeur &ndash; for he was &ldquo;showing off,&rdquo;
too.</p>

<p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters&#8217;s ecstasy
complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough &ndash; he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have
that German lad back again with a sound mind.</p>

<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine
yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This
was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application
from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it
&ndash; here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom
was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the
great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of
the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to
the judicial one&#8217;s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy &ndash; but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for
the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised
themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the
grass.</p>

<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent
could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush,
for the poor fellow&#8217;s instinct taught him that there was a mystery here
that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that
<em>this</em> boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on
his premises &ndash; a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.</p>

<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face
&ndash; but he wouldn&#8217;t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went &ndash; came again; she watched; a
furtive glance told her worlds &ndash; and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all
(she thought).</p>

<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath would
hardly come, his heart quaked &ndash; partly because of the awful greatness of
the man, but mainly because he was <em>her</em> parent. He would have liked to
fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on
Tom&#8217;s head and called him a fine little man, and asked him what his name
was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not Tom &ndash; it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&#8217;s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe.
That&#8217;s very well. But you&#8217;ve another one I daresay, and you&#8217;ll
tell it to me, won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,&rdquo; said Walters,
&ldquo;and say <em>sir</em>. You mustn&#8217;t forget your manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Sawyer &ndash; sir.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-25" class="illustration">

<p>TOM AS A SUNDAY-SCHOOL HERO.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little
fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many &ndash; very, very great many. And
you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is
worth more than anything there is in the world; it&#8217;s what makes great men
and good men; you&#8217;ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day,
Thomas, and then you&#8217;ll look back and say, It&#8217;s all owing to the
precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood &ndash; it&#8217;s all owing to
my dear teachers that taught me to learn &ndash; it&#8217;s all owing to the
good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
beautiful Bible &ndash; a splendid elegant Bible &ndash; to keep and have it all
for my own, always &ndash; it&#8217;s all owing to right bringing up! That is
what you will say, Thomas &ndash; and you wouldn&#8217;t take any money for
those two thousand verses &ndash; no indeed you wouldn&#8217;t. And now you
wouldn&#8217;t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you&#8217;ve
learned &ndash; no, I know you wouldn&#8217;t &ndash; for we are proud of little
boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples.
Won&#8217;t you tell us the names of the first two that were
appointed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, and
his eyes fell. Mr. Walters&#8217;s heart sank within him. He said to himself, it
is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question &ndash; why
<em>did</em> the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer the gentleman, Thomas &ndash; don&#8217;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I know you&#8217;ll tell me,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;The
names of the first two disciples were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="caps">David and Goliath!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.</p>
