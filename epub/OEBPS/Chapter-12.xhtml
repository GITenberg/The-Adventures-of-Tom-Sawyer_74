<p><span class="first-word">One</span> of the reasons why Tom&#8217;s mind had
drifted away from its secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty
matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school.
Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to &ldquo;whistle her
down the wind,&rdquo; but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her
father&#8217;s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if
she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was
nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy
in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of
remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent
medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was
an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line
came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was
never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all
the &ldquo;Health&rdquo; periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn
ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the
&ldquo;rot&rdquo; they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and
how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to
take, and what frame of mind to keep one&#8217;s self in, and what sort of
clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had
recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day
was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack
periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on
her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with &ldquo;hell following
after.&rdquo; But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and
the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.</p>

<p>AUNT POLLY SEEKS INFORMATION.</p>
</div>

<p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom&#8217;s low condition was a
windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him
down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in
a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and
&ldquo;the yellow stains of it came through his pores&rdquo; &ndash; as Tom
said.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale
and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The
boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim
oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a
jug&#8217;s, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.</p>

<p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the
old lady&#8217;s heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up
at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot
at once. She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a
liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her
faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a tea-spoonful and watched with the deepest
anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace
again; for the &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; was broken up. The boy could not have
shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.</p>

<p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic
enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little
sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various
plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of
Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt
ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid,
she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she
watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really
diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a
crack in the sitting-room floor with it.</p>

<p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt&#8217;s yellow
cat came along, purring, eyeing the tea-spoon avariciously, and begging for a
taste. Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Peter signified that he did want it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You better make sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter was sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&#8217;ve asked for it, and I&#8217;ll give it to you, because
there ain&#8217;t anything mean about <em>me</em>; but if you find you
don&#8217;t like it, you mustn&#8217;t blame anybody but your own
self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the
Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a
war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture,
upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet
and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder
and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing
around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly
entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty
hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her
glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.</p>

<p>A GENERAL GOOD TIME.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, what on earth ails that cat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t know, aunt,&rdquo; gasped the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I never see anything like it. What <em>did</em> make him act
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Deed I don&#8217;t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when
they&#8217;re having a good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do, do they?&rdquo; There was something in the tone that made Tom
apprehensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8217;m. That is, I believe they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>do</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8217;m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by
anxiety. Too late he divined her &ldquo;drift.&rdquo; The handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom
winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle &ndash;
his ear &ndash; and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so,
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done it out of pity for him &ndash; because he hadn&#8217;t any
aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&#8217;t any aunt! &ndash; you numskull. What has that got to do
with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaps. Because if he&#8217;d had one she&#8217;d a burnt him out
herself! She&#8217;d a roasted his bowels out of him &#8217;thout any more
feeling than if he was a human!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new
light; what was cruelty to a cat <em>might</em> be cruelty to a boy, too. She
began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand
on Tom&#8217;s head and said gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it <em>did</em> do you
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his
gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter.
It done <em>him</em> good, too. I never see him get around so
since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go &#8217;long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And
you try and see if you can&#8217;t be a good boy, for once, and you
needn&#8217;t take any more medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had
been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the
gate of the school-yard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he
said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he
really was looking &ndash; down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight,
and Tom&#8217;s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully
away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and &ldquo;led up&rdquo; warily to
opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the
bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight,
and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last
frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
the empty school-house and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at
the gate, and Tom&#8217;s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out,
and &ldquo;going on&rdquo; like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing
on his head &ndash; doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and
keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing.
But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be
possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to
her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy&#8217;s cap,
hurled it to the roof of the school-house, broke through a group of boys,
tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under
Becky&#8217;s nose, almost upsetting her &ndash; and she turned, with her nose
in the air, and he heard her say: &ldquo;Mf! some people think they&#8217;re
mighty smart &ndash; always showing off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed
and crestfallen.</p>
