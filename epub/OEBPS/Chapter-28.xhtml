<p><span class="first-word">That</span> night Tom and Huck were ready for their
adventure. They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one
watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered
the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to
come and &ldquo;maow,&rdquo; whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But
the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an
empty sugar hogshead about twelve.</p>

<p>HUCK AT HOME.</p>
</div>

<p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night
promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt&#8217;s old tin
lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in
Huck&#8217;s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the
tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No
Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was
auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was
interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.</p>

<p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel,
and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry
and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety
that weighed upon Huck&#8217;s spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he
could see a flash from the lantern &ndash; it would frighten him, but it would
at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had
disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had
burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing
closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his
breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by
thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating.
Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him:
&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;run, for your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He needn&#8217;t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped
till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the
village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured
down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn&#8217;t hardly get
my breath I was so scared. They wouldn&#8217;t turn in the lock, either. Well,
without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the
door! It warn&#8217;t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and,
<em>great CÃ¦sar&#8217;s ghost!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! &ndash; what&#8217;d you see, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe&#8217;s hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE HAUNTED ROOM.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
started!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d never a thought of the towel, I bet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Tom, did you see that box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, I didn&#8217;t wait to look around. I didn&#8217;t see the box,
I didn&#8217;t see the cross. I didn&#8217;t see anything but a bottle and a tin
cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in
the room. Don&#8217;t you see, now, what&#8217;s the matter with that
ha&#8217;nted room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&#8217;s ha&#8217;nted with whiskey! Maybe <em>all</em> the
Temperance Taverns have got a ha&#8217;nted room, hey, Huck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon maybe that&#8217;s so. Who&#8217;d a thought such a
thing? But say, Tom, now&#8217;s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun
Joe&#8217;s drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, that! You try it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no &ndash; I reckon not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <em>I</em> reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun
Joe ain&#8217;t enough. If there&#8217;d been three, he&#8217;d be drunk enough
and I&#8217;d do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Joe&#8217;s not in there. It&#8217;s too scary. Now, if we watch every night,
we&#8217;ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then
we&#8217;ll snatch that box quicker&#8217;n lightning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m agreed. I&#8217;ll watch the whole night long, and
I&#8217;ll do it every night, too, if you&#8217;ll do the other part of the
job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
block and maow &ndash; and if I&#8217;m asleep, you throw some gravel at the
window and that&#8217;ll fetch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed, and good as wheat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Huck, the storm&#8217;s over, and I&#8217;ll go home. It&#8217;ll
begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I would, Tom, and I will. I&#8217;ll ha&#8217;nt that tavern
every night for a year! I&#8217;ll sleep all day and I&#8217;ll stand watch all
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Ben Rogers&#8217;s hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap&#8217;s
nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and
any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
That&#8217;s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don&#8217;t ever
act as if I was above him. Sometime I&#8217;ve set right down and eat
<em>with</em> him. But you needn&#8217;t tell that. A body&#8217;s got to do
things when he&#8217;s awful hungry he wouldn&#8217;t want to do as a steady
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I don&#8217;t want you in the daytime, I&#8217;ll let you
sleep. I won&#8217;t come bothering around. Any time you see something&#8217;s
up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.&rdquo;</p>
