<p><span class="first-word">But</span> there was no hilarity in the little town
that same tranquil Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly&#8217;s
family, were being put into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An
unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in
all conscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and
talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
school-house yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing there to
comfort her. She soliloquized:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven&#8217;t got
anything now to remember him by.&rdquo; And she choked back a little sob.</p>

<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn&#8217;t
say that &ndash; I wouldn&#8217;t say it for the whole world. But he&#8217;s
gone now; I&#8217;ll never, never, never see him any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling down
her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls &ndash; playmates of
Tom&#8217;s and Joe&#8217;s &ndash; came by, and stood looking over the paling
fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they
saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful
prophecy, as they could easily see now!) &ndash; and each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added something
like &ldquo;and I was a-standing just so &ndash; just as I am now, and as if you
was him &ndash; I was as close as that &ndash; and he smiled, just this way
&ndash; and then something seemed to go all over me, like &ndash; awful, you
know &ndash; and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and many
claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered
with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who <em>did</em> see the
departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took
upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all
the rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably
manifest pride in the remembrance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and so
that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still
recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.</p>

<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began to
toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still Sabbath, and the
mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature. The
villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in
whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only the
funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the
silence there. None could remember when the little church had been so full
before. There was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt
Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew. There was
another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the
minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the
text followed: &ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces, the
winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there,
thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had
persistently blinded himself to them always before, and had as persistently seen
only faults and flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a touching
incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet,
generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful
those episodes were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred
they had seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The
congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at
last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of
anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in
the pulpit.</p>

<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the
church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his
handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair of eyes
followed the minister&#8217;s, and then almost with one impulse the congregation
rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the
lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the
rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral
sermon!</p>

<p>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones,
smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood
abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from
so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom seized
him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Polly, it ain&#8217;t fair. Somebody&#8217;s got to be glad to
see Huck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so they shall. <em>I</em>&#8217;m glad to see him, poor motherless
thing!&rdquo; And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the
one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.</p>

<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: &ldquo;Praise God from
whom all blessings flow &ndash; <span class="caps">Sing!</span> &ndash; and put
your hearts in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while it
shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles
about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his
life.</p>

<p>TOM&#8217;S PROUDEST MOMENT.</p>
</div>

<p>As the &ldquo;sold&rdquo; congregation trooped out they said they would
almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
once more.</p>

<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day &ndash; according to Aunt
Polly&#8217;s varying moods &ndash; than he had earned before in a year; and he
hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for
himself.</p>
