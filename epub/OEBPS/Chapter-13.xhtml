<p><span class="first-word">Tom&#8217;s</span> mind was made up now. He was
gloomy and desperate. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved
him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be
sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since
nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
<em>him</em> for the consequences &ndash; why shouldn&#8217;t they? What right
had the friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
lead a life of crime. There was no choice.</p>

<p>By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
&ldquo;take up&rdquo; tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more &ndash; it was very
hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold world, he
must submit &ndash; but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.</p>

<p>Just at this point he met his soul&#8217;s sworn comrade, Joe Harper &ndash;
hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly
here were &ldquo;two souls with but a single thought.&rdquo; Tom, wiping his
eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to
escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the
great world never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget
him.</p>

<p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to
make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had
whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing
about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt
that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be
happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world
to suffer and die.</p>

<p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by
each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their
troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and
living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and
grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous
advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.</p>

<p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was
a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a
shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not
inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost
wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson&#8217;s Island was chosen. Who were to be
the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them. Then
they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers
were one to him; he was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a
lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour
&ndash; which was midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to
capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way &ndash; as became outlaws. And before the
afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading
the fact that pretty soon the town would &ldquo;hear something.&rdquo; All who
got this vague hint were cautioned to &ldquo;be mum and wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped
in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was
starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom
listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low,
distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more;
these signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your
names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the
Seas.&rdquo; Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tis well. Give the countersign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="caps">Blood!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an easy,
comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages
of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.</p>

<p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and
a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few corn-cobs to
make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or &ldquo;chewed&rdquo; but
himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start
without some fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in
that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above,
and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an
imposing adventure of it, saying, &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; every now and then, and
suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary
dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if &ldquo;the foe&rdquo;
stirred, to &ldquo;let him have it to the hilt,&rdquo; because &ldquo;dead men
tell no tales.&rdquo; They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at
the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for
their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.</p>

<p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at
the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and gave
his orders in a low, stern whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luff, and bring her to the wind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye-aye, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, steady-y-y-y!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady it is, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go off a point!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Point it is, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was
no doubt understood that these orders were given only for &ldquo;style,&rdquo;
and were not intended to mean anything in particular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sail&#8217;s she carrying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courses, tops&#8217;ls, and flying-jib, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send the r&#8217;yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye
&ndash; foretopmaststuns&#8217;l! Lively, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye-aye, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake out that maintogalans&#8217;l! Sheets and braces! <em>Now</em>
my hearties!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye-aye, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hellum-a-lee &ndash; hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes!
Port, port! <em>Now</em>, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady it is, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not more
than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next
three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two
or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the
vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that
was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, &ldquo;looking
his last&rdquo; upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and
wishing &ldquo;she&rdquo; could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing
peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his
lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson&#8217;s
Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he &ldquo;looked his last&rdquo;
with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last,
too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and
made shift to avert it. About two o&#8217;clock in the morning the raft grounded
on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back
and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft&#8217;s
belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the
bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep
in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.</p>

<p>ON BOARD THEIR FIRST PRIZE.</p>
</div>

<p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the
frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn &ldquo;pone&rdquo; stock
they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way
in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the
haunts of men, and they said they never would return to civilization. The
climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared
tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and
festooning vines.</p>

<p>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn
pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with
contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny
themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire.</p>

<p>THE PIRATES ASHORE.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ain&#8217;t</em> it gay?&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s <em>nuts</em>!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;What would the boys
say if they could see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say? Well, they&#8217;d just die to be here &ndash; hey,
Hucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; said Huckleberry; &ldquo;anyways,
<em>I</em>&#8217;m suited. I don&#8217;t want nothing better&#8217;n this. I
don&#8217;t ever get enough to eat, gen&#8217;ally &ndash; and here they
can&#8217;t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s just the life for me,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;You
don&#8217;t have to get up, mornings, and you don&#8217;t have to go to school,
and wash, and all that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don&#8217;t have to
do <em>anything</em>, Joe, when he&#8217;s ashore, but a hermit <em>he</em> has
to be praying considerable, and then he don&#8217;t have any fun, anyway, all by
himself that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, that&#8217;s so,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;but I hadn&#8217;t
thought much about it, you know. I&#8217;d a good deal rather be a pirate, now
that I&#8217;ve tried it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;people don&#8217;t go much on
hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate&#8217;s always
respected. And a hermit&#8217;s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find,
and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?&rdquo; inquired
Huck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> dono. But they&#8217;ve <em>got</em> to do it. Hermits
always do. You&#8217;d have to do that if you was a hermit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dern&#8217;d if I would,&rdquo; said Huck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dono. But I wouldn&#8217;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Huck, you&#8217;d <em>have</em> to. How&#8217;d you get around
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I just wouldn&#8217;t stand it. I&#8217;d run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run away! Well, you <em>would</em> be a nice old slouch of a hermit.
You&#8217;d be a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco,
and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke
&ndash; he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates
envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.
Presently Huck said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does pirates have to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have just a bully time &ndash; take ships and burn them, and
get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there&#8217;s
ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships &ndash; make
&#8217;em walk a plank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they carry the women to the island,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;they
don&#8217;t kill the women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented Tom, &ldquo;they don&#8217;t kill the women
&ndash; they&#8217;re too noble. And the women&#8217;s always beautiful,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&#8217;t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and
silver and di&#8217;monds,&rdquo; said Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Huck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the pirates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I ain&#8217;t dressed fitten for a pirate,&rdquo; said he,
with a regretful pathos in his voice; &ldquo;but I ain&#8217;t got none but
these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after
they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor
rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to
start with a proper wardrobe.</p>

<p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids
of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he
slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and
the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep.
They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there
with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind
not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that,
lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep &ndash; but an
intruder came, now, that would not &ldquo;down.&rdquo; It was conscience. They
began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next
they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to
argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and
apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin
plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around
the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only &ldquo;hooking,&rdquo; while
taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple <em>stealing</em>
&ndash; and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly
resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should
not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a
truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</p>
