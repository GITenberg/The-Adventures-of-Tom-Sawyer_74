<p><span class="first-word">Now</span> to return to Tom and Becky&#8217;s share
in the pic-nic. They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the
company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave &ndash; wonders dubbed with
rather over-descriptive names, such as &ldquo;The Drawing-Room,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Cathedral,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aladdin&#8217;s Palace,&rdquo; and so on.
Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it
with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they
wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the
tangled web-work of names, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with which
the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and
talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose
walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf
and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water,
trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the
slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and
imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate
it for Becky&#8217;s gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep
natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the
ambition to be a discoverer seized him.</p>

<p>WONDERS OF THE CAVE.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for
future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that, far
down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in
search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a
spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites
of the length and circumference of a man&#8217;s leg; they walked all about it,
wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages
that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose
basin was incrusted with a frost-work of glittering crystals; it was in the
midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had
been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the
result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of
bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed
the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting
furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of
conduct. He seized Becky&#8217;s hand and hurried her into the first corridor
that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky&#8217;s light out with
its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a
good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered,
and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake,
shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best
to sit down and rest a while, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness
of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&#8217;t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard
any of the others.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-141" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-141.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>ATTACKED BY NATIVES.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them &ndash; and I
don&#8217;t know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We
couldn&#8217;t hear them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky grew apprehensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how long we&#8217;ve been down here, Tom? We better start
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon we better. P&#8217;raps we better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find the way, Tom? It&#8217;s all a mixed-up crookedness to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I could find it &ndash; but then the bats. If they put our
candles out it will be an awful fix. Let&#8217;s try some other way, so as not
to go through there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well. But I hope we won&#8217;t get lost. It would be so awful!&rdquo;
and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.</p>

<p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way,
glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the
look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky
would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&#8217;s all right. This ain&#8217;t the one, but we&#8217;ll
come to it right away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to
turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding
the one that was wanted. He still said it was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; but there
was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and
sounded just as if he had said, &ldquo;All is lost!&rdquo; Becky clung to his
side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they
would come. At last she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let&#8217;s go back that way! We seem to
get worse and worse off all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous
in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died
out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,&rdquo; said
Becky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they <em>might</em> hear us, you
know,&rdquo; and he shouted again.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;might&rdquo; was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter,
it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but
there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his
steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner
revealed another fearful fact to Becky &ndash; he could not find his way
back!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, you didn&#8217;t make any marks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want
to come back! No &ndash; I can&#8217;t find the way. It&#8217;s all mixed
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, Tom, we&#8217;re lost! we&#8217;re lost! We never can get out of
this awful place! Oh, why <em>did</em> we ever leave the others!&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-142" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-142.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>DESPAIR.</p>
</div>

<p>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was
appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by
her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to
him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes
turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and
she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her
into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try
to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she
said.</p>

<p>So they moved on again &ndash; aimlessly &ndash; simply at random &ndash; all
they could do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
reviving &ndash; not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
familiarity with failure.</p>

<p>By and by Tom took Becky&#8217;s candle and blew it out. This economy meant
so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She
knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets &ndash;
yet he must economize.</p>

<p>By and by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to
be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least
progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten
its pursuit.</p>

<p>At last Becky&#8217;s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the
comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think
of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown threadbare
with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she
drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and
saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by
and by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of
peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone
times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with
a breezy little laugh &ndash; but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a
groan followed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how <em>could</em> I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No!
No, I don&#8217;t, Tom! Don&#8217;t look so! I won&#8217;t say it
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve slept, Becky; you&#8217;ll feel rested,
now, and we&#8217;ll find the way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can try, Tom; but I&#8217;ve seen such a beautiful country in my
dream. I reckon we are going there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let&#8217;s go on
trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried to
estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it
seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their
candles were not gone yet. A long time after this &ndash; they could not tell
how long &ndash; Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water
&ndash; they must find a spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was
time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she
could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not
understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front
of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time.
Then Becky broke the silence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, I am so hungry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom took something out of his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember this?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Becky almost smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s our wedding cake, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes &ndash; I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it&#8217;s all
we&#8217;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saved it from the pic-nic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up
people do with wedding cake &ndash; but it&#8217;ll be our&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-143" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-143.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>THE WEDDING CAKE.</p>
</div>

<p>She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate
with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of cold
water to finish the feast with. By and by Becky suggested that they move on
again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky&#8217;s face paled, but she thought she could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there&#8217;s water to
drink. That little piece is our last candle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her,
but with little effect. At length Becky said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Becky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&#8217;ll miss us and hunt for us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they will! Certainly they will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&#8217;re hunting for us now, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When would they miss us, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they get back to the boat, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, it might be dark then &ndash; would they notice we hadn&#8217;t
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as
they got home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A frightened look in Becky&#8217;s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The
children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from
Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also &ndash; that
the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that
Becky was not at Mrs. Harper&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt
slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw
the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its
top a moment, and then &ndash; the horror of utter darkness reigned!</p>

<p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she
was crying in Tom&#8217;s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that
after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of
sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now
&ndash; maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too
oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed
long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some
one would come. He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so
hideously that he tried it no more.</p>

<p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
portion of Tom&#8217;s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
desire.</p>

<p>By and by Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sh!</em> Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest,
far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started
groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again
the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s them!&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;they&#8217;re coming! Come
along, Becky &ndash; we&#8217;re all right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against.
They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it might
be a hundred &ndash; there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his
breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and
wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings
were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether.
The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of
no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and
no sounds came again.</p>

<p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on;
they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be
Tuesday by this time.</p>

<p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would
be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in
idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he
and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At
the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a &ldquo;jumping-off place.&rdquo;
Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as
he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a
little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human
hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious
shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to &ndash;
Injun Joe&#8217;s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified
the next moment, to see the &ldquo;Spaniard&rdquo; take to his heels and get
himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and
come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom&#8217;s fright
weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength
enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt
him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from
Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted &ldquo;for
luck.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-144" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-144.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>A NEW TERROR.</p>
</div>

<p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run. Another
tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children
awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or
Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given
over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe
and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary
apathy and would not be roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and
die &ndash; it would not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and
explore if he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and
speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would
stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.</p>

<p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of
being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he
took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his
hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming
doom.</p>
