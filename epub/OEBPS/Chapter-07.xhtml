<p><span class="first-word">The</span> harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on
his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he
gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was
utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy
days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the
soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming
sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of
heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high
in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were
asleep. Tom&#8217;s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of
interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and
his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know
it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put
him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he
started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him
take a new direction.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant.
This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week,
and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to
assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom
said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest
benefit of the tick. So he put Joe&#8217;s slate on the desk and drew a line
down the middle of it from top to bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as long as he is on your side you can stir
him up and I&#8217;ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my
side, you&#8217;re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead; start him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed
him a while, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base
occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the
other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over
the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to
settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and
got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as
he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom&#8217;s fingers
would be twitching to begin, Joe&#8217;s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong.
So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said
he:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, you let him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it ain&#8217;t fair; you just let him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame it, I ain&#8217;t going to stir him much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him alone, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall &ndash; he&#8217;s on my side of the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t care whose tick he is &ndash; he&#8217;s on my
side of the line, and you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t touch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ll just bet I will, though. He&#8217;s my tick and
I&#8217;ll do what I blame please with him, or die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom&#8217;s shoulders, and its duplicate on
Joe&#8217;s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the
two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to
notice the hush that had stolen upon the school a while before when the master
came tip-toeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a good
part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.</p>

<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in
her ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put on your bonnet and let on you&#8217;re going home; and when you
get to the corner, give the rest of &#8217;em the slip, and turn down through
the lane and come back. I&#8217;ll go the other way and come it over &#8217;em
the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another.
In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached
the school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate
before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it,
and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to wane,
the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love rats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I hate them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do, too &ndash; <em>live</em> ones. But I mean dead ones, to
swing round your head with a string.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t care for rats much, anyway. What <em>I</em> like is
chewing-gum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you? I&#8217;ve got some. I&#8217;ll let you chew it a while, but
you must give it back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
against the bench in excess of contentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was you ever at a circus?&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my pa&#8217;s going to take me again some time, if I&#8217;m
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I been to the circus three or four times &ndash; lots of times. Church
ain&#8217;t shucks to a circus. There&#8217;s things going on at a circus all
the time. I&#8217;m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you! That will be nice. They&#8217;re so lovely, all spotted
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s so. And they get slathers of money &ndash; most a
dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, engaged to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon so. I don&#8217;t know. What is it like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like? Why it ain&#8217;t like anything. You only just tell a boy you
won&#8217;t ever have anybody but him, ever ever <em>ever</em>, and then you
kiss and that&#8217;s all. Anybody can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss? What do you kiss for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that, you know, is to &ndash; well, they always do
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, everybody that&#8217;s in love with each other. Do you
remember what I wrote on the slate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye &ndash; yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell <em>you</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye &ndash; yes &ndash; but some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not now &ndash; to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, <em>now</em>. Please, Becky &ndash; I&#8217;ll whisper it,
I&#8217;ll whisper it ever so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her
waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear.
And then he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you whisper it to me &ndash; just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You turn your face away so you can&#8217;t see, and then I will. But
you mustn&#8217;t ever tell anybody &ndash; <em>will</em> you, Tom? Now you
won&#8217;t, <em>will</em> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, indeed I won&#8217;t. Now, Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his
curls and whispered, &ldquo;I &ndash; love &ndash; you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with
Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron
to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Becky, it&#8217;s all done &ndash; all over but the kiss.
Don&#8217;t you be afraid of that &ndash; it ain&#8217;t anything at all.
Please, Becky.&rdquo; And he tugged at her apron and the hands.</p>

<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the
struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it&#8217;s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you
ain&#8217;t ever to love anybody but me, and you ain&#8217;t ever to marry
anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&#8217;ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I&#8217;ll never
marry anybody but you &ndash; and you ain&#8217;t to ever marry anybody but me,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Of course. That&#8217;s <em>part</em> of it. And always
coming to school or when we&#8217;re going home, you&#8217;re to walk with me,
when there ain&#8217;t anybody looking &ndash; and you choose me and I choose
you at parties, because that&#8217;s the way you do when you&#8217;re
engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s so nice. I never heard of it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&#8217;s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom! Then I ain&#8217;t the first you&#8217;ve ever been engaged
to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t cry, Becky, I don&#8217;t care for her any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do, Tom &ndash; you know you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>VAIN PLEADING.</p>
</div>

<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned
her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with soothing words
in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away
and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at
the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him. But
she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It
was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to
it and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
her face to the wall. Tom&#8217;s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becky, I &ndash; I don&#8217;t care for anybody but you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No reply &ndash; but sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becky&rdquo; &ndash; pleadingly. &ldquo;Becky, won&#8217;t you say
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>More sobs.</p>

<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and
passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Becky, won&#8217;t you take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the
hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began
to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the
play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom! Come back, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but
silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by
this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and
still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching
afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.</p>
