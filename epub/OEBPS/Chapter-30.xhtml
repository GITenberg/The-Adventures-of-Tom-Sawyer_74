<p><span class="first-word">As</span> the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on
Sunday morning, Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old
Welshman&#8217;s door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set
on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came
from a window:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck&#8217;s scared voice answered in a low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let me in! It&#8217;s only Huck Finn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a name that can open this door night or day, lad! &ndash;
and welcome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy&#8217;s ears, and the
pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had
ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons
speedily dressed themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my boy, I hope you&#8217;re good and hungry, because breakfast
will be ready as soon as the sun&#8217;s up, and we&#8217;ll have a piping hot
one, too &ndash; make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you&#8217;d
turn up and stop here last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was awful scared,&rdquo; said Huck, &ldquo;and I run. I took out
when the pistols went off, and I didn&#8217;t stop for three mile. I&#8217;ve
come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight
becuz I didn&#8217;t want to run across them devils, even if they was
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, poor chap, you do look as if you&#8217;d had a hard night of it
&ndash; but there&#8217;s a bed here for you when you&#8217;ve had your
breakfast. No, they ain&#8217;t dead, lad &ndash; we are sorry enough for that.
You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we
crept along on tip-toe till we got within fifteen feet of them &ndash; dark as a
cellar that sumach path was &ndash; and just then I found I was going to sneeze.
It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use &ndash;
&#8217;twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol
raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of
the path, I sung out, &lsquo;Fire boys!&rsquo; and blazed away at the place
where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those
villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched
them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and
didn&#8217;t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit
chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together,
and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and
a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I
wish we had some sort of description of those rascals &ndash; &#8217;twould help
a good deal. But you couldn&#8217;t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-133" class="illustration">

<p>RESULT OF A SNEEZE.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Describe them &ndash; describe them, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&#8217;s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that&#8217;s ben around
here once or twice, and t&#8217;other&#8217;s a mean-looking,
ragged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the
woods back of the widow&#8217;s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you,
boys, and tell the sheriff &ndash; get your breakfast to-morrow
morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Welshman&#8217;s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room
Huck sprang up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&#8217;t tell <em>any</em>body it was me that blowed on
them! Oh, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of
what you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no! Please don&#8217;t tell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&#8217;t tell &ndash; and I won&#8217;t. But why don&#8217;t
you want it known?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much
about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything
against him for the whole world &ndash; he would be killed for knowing it,
sure.</p>

<p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
suspicious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I&#8217;m a kind of a hard lot, &ndash; least everybody
says so, and I don&#8217;t see nothing agin it &ndash; and sometimes I
can&#8217;t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to
strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I
couldn&#8217;t sleep, and so I come along up-street &#8217;bout midnight,
a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the
Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just
then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something
under their arm, and I reckoned they&#8217;d stole it. One was a-smoking, and
t&#8217;other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars
lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by
his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t&#8217;other one was a rusty,
ragged-looking devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&#8217;t know &ndash; but somehow it seems as if I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they went on, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follered &#8217;em &ndash; yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was
up &ndash; they sneaked along so. I dogged &#8217;em to the widder&#8217;s
stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and
the Spaniard swear he&#8217;d spile her looks just as I told you and your
two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! The <em>deaf and dumb</em> man said all that!&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-134" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-134.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>CORNERED.</p>
</div>

<p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the
old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his
tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He
made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man&#8217;s eye was
upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy, don&#8217;t be afraid of me. I wouldn&#8217;t hurt a hair of
your head for all the world. No &ndash; I&#8217;d protect you &ndash; I&#8217;d
protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you&#8217;ve let that slip
without intending it; you can&#8217;t cover that up now. You know something
about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me &ndash; tell me
what it is, and trust me &ndash; I won&#8217;t betray you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck looked into the old man&#8217;s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a Spaniard &ndash; it&#8217;s Injun
Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears
and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white
men don&#8217;t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That&#8217;s a
different matter altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said
that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to
get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They
found none, but captured a bulky bundle of&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of <span class="caps">what</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from Huck&#8217;s blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide,
now, and his breath suspended &ndash; waiting for the answer. The Welshman
started &ndash; stared in return &ndash; three seconds &ndash; five seconds
&ndash; ten &ndash; then replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of burglar&#8217;s tools. Why, what&#8217;s the <em>matter</em> with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously &ndash; and presently said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, burglar&#8217;s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal.
But what did give you that turn? What were <em>you</em> expecting we&#8217;d
found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck was in a close place &ndash; the inquiring eye was upon him &ndash; he
would have given anything for material for a plausible answer &ndash; nothing
suggested itself &ndash; the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper &ndash;
a senseless reply offered &ndash; there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture
he uttered it &ndash; feebly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunday-school books, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by
saying that such a laugh was money in a man&#8217;s pocket, because it cut down
the doctor&#8217;s bill like everything. Then he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old chap, you&#8217;re white and jaded &ndash; you ain&#8217;t
well a bit &ndash; no wonder you&#8217;re a little flighty and off your balance.
But you&#8217;ll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a
suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from
the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the
widow&#8217;s stile. He had only <em>thought</em> it was not the treasure,
however &ndash; he had not known that it wasn&#8217;t &ndash; and so the
suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the
whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not <em>the</em> bundle, and so his mind was at
rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just
in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would
be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night
without any trouble or any fear of interruption.</p>

<p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped
for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the
late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the
Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill
&ndash; to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell
the story of the night to the visitors. The widow&#8217;s gratitude for her
preservation was outspoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t say a word about it, madam. There&#8217;s another that
you&#8217;re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he
don&#8217;t allow me to tell his name. We wouldn&#8217;t have been there but for
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main
matter &ndash; but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to
part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise. Why didn&#8217;t you come and wake me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We judged it warn&#8217;t worth while. Those fellows warn&#8217;t
likely to come again &ndash; they hadn&#8217;t any tools left to work with, and
what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men
stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They&#8217;ve just come
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of
hours more.</p>

<p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was
early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a
sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished,
Judge Thatcher&#8217;s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down
the aisle with the crowd and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Becky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a startled look &ndash; &ldquo;didn&#8217;t she stay
with you last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-135" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-135.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>ALARMING DISCOVERIES.</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking
briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good morning, Mrs. Harper. I&#8217;ve got
a boy that&#8217;s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
night &ndash; one of you. And now he&#8217;s afraid to come to church.
I&#8217;ve got to settle with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&#8217;t stay with us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harper, beginning to
look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8217;m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see him last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped
moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took
possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young
teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board
the ferry-boat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if
any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were
still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street,
and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was
up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were
forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferry-boat ordered out,
and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down
high-road and river toward the cave.</p>

<div id="ill-136" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-136.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>TOM AND BECKY STIR UP THE TOWN.</p>
</div>

<p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited
Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them,
too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited
for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was,
&ldquo;Send more candles &ndash; and send food.&rdquo; Mrs. Thatcher was almost
crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and
encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.</p>

<p>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease,
smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had
been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the
cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she
would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he
was the Lord&#8217;s, and nothing that was the Lord&#8217;s was a thing to be
neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can depend on it. That&#8217;s the Lord&#8217;s mark. He
don&#8217;t leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature
that comes from his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news
that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked
that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to
be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,
lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and
shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the
sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists,
the names &ldquo;<span class="caps">Becky &amp; Tom</span>&rdquo; had been found
traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled
bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said
it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other
memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from
the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the
cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would
burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle &ndash; and
then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it
was only a searcher&#8217;s light.</p>

<div id="ill-137" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-137.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>TOM&#8217;S MARK.</p>
</div>

<p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the
village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The
accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern
kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as
the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns,
and finally asked &ndash; dimly dreading the worst &ndash; if anything had been
discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the widow.</p>

<p>Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liquor! &ndash; and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child
&ndash; what a turn you did give me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only tell me just one thing &ndash; only just one &ndash; please! Was
it Tom Sawyer that found it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The widow burst into tears. &ldquo;Hush, hush, child, hush! I&#8217;ve told
you before, you must <em>not</em> talk. You are very, very sick!&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-138" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-138.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>HUCK QUESTIONS THE WIDOW.</p>
</div>

<p>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great pow-wow
if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever &ndash; gone forever!
But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.</p>

<p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck&#8217;s mind, and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There &ndash; he&#8217;s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity
but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain&#8217;t many left, now,
that&#8217;s got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on
searching.&rdquo;</p>
