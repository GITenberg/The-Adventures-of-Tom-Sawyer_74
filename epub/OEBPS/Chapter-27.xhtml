<p><span class="first-word">The</span> adventure of the day mightily tormented
Tom&#8217;s dreams that night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure
and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the
early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that
they seemed curiously subdued and far away &ndash; somewhat as if they had
happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it occurred to him
that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There was one very strong
argument in favor of this idea &ndash; namely, that the quantity of coin he had
seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one
mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he
imagined that all references to &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thousands&rdquo; were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such
sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so
large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any
one&#8217;s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed,
they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of
vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.</p>

<p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under
the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning
to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all. This
uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and
find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling
his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck
lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved
to have been only a dream.</p>

<p>THE NEXT DAY&#8217;S CONFERENCE.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Huck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence, for a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, if we&#8217;d a left the blame tools at the dead tree, we&#8217;d
a got the money. Oh, ain&#8217;t it awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a dream, then, &#8217;tain&#8217;t a dream!
Somehow I most wish it was. Dog&#8217;d if I don&#8217;t, Huck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ain&#8217;t a dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dream! If them stairs hadn&#8217;t broke down you&#8217;d a seen how
much dream it was! I&#8217;ve had dreams enough all night &ndash; with that
patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through &#8217;em &ndash; rot
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not rot him. <em>Find</em> him! Track the money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, we&#8217;ll never find him. A feller don&#8217;t have only one
chance for such a pile &ndash; and that one&#8217;s lost. I&#8217;d feel mighty
shaky if I was to see him, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so&#8217;d I; but I&#8217;d like to see him, anyway &ndash; and
track him out &ndash; to his Number Two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number Two &ndash; yes, that&#8217;s it. I been thinking &#8217;bout
that. But I can&#8217;t make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dono. It&#8217;s too deep. Say, Huck &ndash; maybe it&#8217;s the
number of a house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goody! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, Tom, that ain&#8217;t it. If it is, it
ain&#8217;t in this one-horse town. They ain&#8217;t no numbers here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&#8217;s so. Lemme think a minute. Here &ndash; it&#8217;s
the number of a room &ndash; in a tavern, you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s the trick! They ain&#8217;t only two taverns. We can
find out quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stay here, Huck, till I come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck&#8217;s company in public
places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2 had
long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the less
ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper&#8217;s young son
said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or
come out of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this
state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had
made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that
room was &ldquo;ha&#8217;nted&rdquo;; had noticed that there was a light in
there the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found out, Huck. I reckon that&#8217;s
the very No. 2 we&#8217;re after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemme think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that
comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle
trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and
I&#8217;ll nip all of auntie&#8217;s, and the first dark night we&#8217;ll go
there and try &#8217;em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he
said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don&#8217;t go to
that No. 2, that ain&#8217;t the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lordy, I don&#8217;t want to foller him by myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&#8217;ll be night, sure. He mightn&#8217;t ever see you
&ndash; and if he did, maybe he&#8217;d never think anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&#8217;s pretty dark I reckon I&#8217;ll track him. I dono
&ndash; I dono. I&#8217;ll try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet <em>I</em>&#8217;ll follow him, if it&#8217;s dark, Huck. Why,
he might a found out he couldn&#8217;t get his revenge, and be going right after
that money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s so, Tom, it&#8217;s so. I&#8217;ll foller him; I will, by
jingoes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&#8217;re <em>talking</em>! Don&#8217;t you ever weaken, Huck,
and I won&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>
