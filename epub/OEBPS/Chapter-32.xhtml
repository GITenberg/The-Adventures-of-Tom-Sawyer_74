<p><span class="first-word">Tuesday</span> afternoon came, and waned to the
twilight. The village of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not
been found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a
private prayer that had the petitioner&#8217;s whole heart in it; but still no
good news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the
quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of
the time delirious. People said it was heart-breaking to hear her call her
child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it
wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled
melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its
rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.</p>

<p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and
in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who
shouted, &ldquo;Turn out! turn out! they&#8217;re found! they&#8217;re
found!&rdquo; Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed
itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage
drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and
swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!</p>

<p>THE &ldquo;TURN OUT&rdquo; TO RECEIVE TOM AND BECKY.</p>
</div>

<p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest
night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour a procession of
villagers filed through Judge Thatcher&#8217;s house, seized the saved ones and
kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher&#8217;s hand, tried to speak but
couldn&#8217;t &ndash; and drifted out raining tears all over the place.</p>

<p>Aunt Polly&#8217;s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher&#8217;s nearly
so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa
with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful
adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed
with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how
he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a
third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when
he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and
groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw
the broad Mississippi rolling by!</p>

<p>And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of
daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went
back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with
such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He
described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for
joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight;
how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat
there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed
them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
didn&#8217;t believe the wild tale at first, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in&rdquo;
&ndash; then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them
rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.</p>

<p>THE ESCAPE FROM THE CAVE.</p>
</div>

<p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were
tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and
informed of the great news.</p>

<p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken
off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden all of
Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the
time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as
whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then
she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.</p>

<p>Tom learned of Huck&#8217;s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was
admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and
introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed.
At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the &ldquo;ragged
man&#8217;s&rdquo; body had eventually been found in the river near the
ferry landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Tom&#8217;s rescue from the cave, he started off to
visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and
Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher&#8217;s house
was on Tom&#8217;s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends
set Tom to talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn&#8217;t like
to go to the cave again. Tom said he thought he wouldn&#8217;t mind it. The
Judge said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I&#8217;ve not the least
doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,
and triple-locked &ndash; and I&#8217;ve got the keys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of
water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The water was brought and thrown into Tom&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, now you&#8217;re all right. What was the matter with you,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judge, Injun Joe&#8217;s in the cave!&rdquo;</p>
