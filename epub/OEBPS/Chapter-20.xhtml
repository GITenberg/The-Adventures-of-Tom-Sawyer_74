<p><span class="first-word">There</span> was something about Aunt Polly&#8217;s
manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him
light-hearted and happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming
upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his
manner. Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation he ran to her and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I&#8217;m so sorry. I
won&#8217;t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live &ndash; please
make up, won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll thank you to keep yourself <em>to</em> yourself, Mr. Thomas
Sawyer. I&#8217;ll never speak to you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even
presence of mind enough to say &ldquo;Who cares, Miss Smarty?&rdquo; until the
right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage,
nevertheless. He moped into the school-yard wishing she were a boy, and imagining
how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered
a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach
was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly
wait for school to &ldquo;take in,&rdquo; she was so impatient to see Tom
flogged for the injured spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of
exposing Alfred Temple, Tom&#8217;s offensive fling had driven it entirely
away.</p>

<p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The
master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition. The
darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he
should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a
mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no
classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an
urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never
came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two
theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed
that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced around;
found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands. The
titlepage &ndash; Professor Somebody&#8217;s &ldquo;Anatomy&rdquo; &ndash;
carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece &ndash; a human figure,
stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in
at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to
close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle.
She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with
shame and vexation.</p>

<p>CAUGHT IN THE ACT.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a
person and look at what they&#8217;re looking at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could <em>I</em> know you was looking at anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you&#8217;re
going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I&#8217;ll be
whipped, and I never was whipped in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she stamped her little foot and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Be</em> so mean if you want to! I know something that&#8217;s
going to happen. You just wait and you&#8217;ll see! Hateful, hateful,
hateful!&rdquo; &ndash; and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of
crying.</p>

<p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said to
himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!
Shucks! What&#8217;s a licking! That&#8217;s just like a girl &ndash;
they&#8217;re so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course <em>I</em>
ain&#8217;t going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there&#8217;s
other ways of getting even on her, that ain&#8217;t so mean; but what of it? Old
Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody&#8217;ll answer. Then
he&#8217;ll do just the way he always does &ndash; ask first one and then
t&#8217;other, and when he comes to the right girl he&#8217;ll know it, without
any telling. Girls&#8217; faces always tell on them. They ain&#8217;t got any
backbone. She&#8217;ll get licked. Well, it&#8217;s a kind of a tight place for
Becky Thatcher, because there ain&#8217;t any way out of it.&rdquo; Tom conned
the thing a moment longer, and then added: &ldquo;All right, though; she&#8217;d
like to see me in just such a fix &ndash; let her sweat it out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
master arrived and school &ldquo;took in.&rdquo; Tom did not feel a strong
interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls&#8217; side
of the room Becky&#8217;s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not
want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get up no
exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the spelling-book
discovery was made, and Tom&#8217;s mind was entirely full of his own matters
for a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed
good interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get out of
his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was
right. The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed
she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she
found she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse
to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself
to keep still &ndash; because, said she to herself, &ldquo;he&#8217;ll tell
about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn&#8217;t say a word, not to save his
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted,
for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the
spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout &ndash; he had denied it for
form&#8217;s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from
principle.</p>

<p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was
drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up,
yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided
whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but
there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr.
Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled
himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted
and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly
he forgot his quarrel with her. Quick &ndash; something must be done! done in a
flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
Good! &ndash; he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and
the chance was lost &ndash; the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the
wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he
said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his
gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was
silence while one might count ten &ndash; the master was gathering his wrath.
Then he spoke: &ldquo;Who tore this book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A denial. Another pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph Harper, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another denial. Tom&#8217;s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of boys &ndash;
considered a while, then turned to the girls:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amy Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shake of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracie Miller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan Harper, did you do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling from
head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rebecca Thatcher&rdquo; [Tom glanced at her face &ndash; it was white
with terror] &ndash; &ldquo;did you tear &ndash; no, look me in the face&rdquo;
[her hands rose in appeal] &ndash; &ldquo;did you tear this book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom&#8217;s brain. He sprang to his
feet and shouted &ndash; &ldquo;<em>I</em> done it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>TOM ASTONISHES THE SCHOOL.</p>
</div>

<p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a moment,
to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his
punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of
poor Becky&#8217;s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by
the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless
flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with
indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school
should be dismissed &ndash; for he knew who would wait for him outside till his
captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.</p>

<p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with
shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery;
but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings,
and he fell asleep at last with Becky&#8217;s latest words lingering dreamily in
his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, how <em>could</em> you be so noble!&rdquo;</p>
