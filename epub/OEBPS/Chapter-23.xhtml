<p><span class="first-word">At</span> last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred
&ndash; and vigorously: the murder trial came on in the court. It became the
absorbing topic of village talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it.
Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled
conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as &ldquo;feelers&rdquo;; he did not see how he could be suspected
of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in
the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time. He took
Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some relief to
unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress with
another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained
discreet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, have you ever told anybody about &ndash; that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Bout what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh &ndash; &#8217;course I haven&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was afeard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn&#8217;t be alive two days if that got found
out. <em>You</em> know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, they couldn&#8217;t anybody get you to tell, could
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me
they could get me to tell. They ain&#8217;t no different way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&#8217;s all right, then. I reckon we&#8217;re safe as long
as we keep mum. But let&#8217;s swear again, anyway. It&#8217;s more
surer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the talk around, Huck? I&#8217;ve heard a power of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk? Well, it&#8217;s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all
the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so&#8217;s I want to hide
som&#8217;ers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon
he&#8217;s a goner. Don&#8217;t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most always &ndash; most always. He ain&#8217;t no account; but then
he hain&#8217;t ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get
money to get drunk on &ndash; and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that &ndash; leastways most of us &ndash; preachers and such like. But
he&#8217;s kind of good &ndash; he give me half a fish, once, when there
warn&#8217;t enough for two; and lots of times he&#8217;s kind of stood by me
when I was out of luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&#8217;s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my
line. I wish we could get him out of there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! we couldn&#8217;t get him out, Tom. And besides,
&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t do any good; they&#8217;d ketch him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes &ndash; so they would. But I hate to hear &#8217;em abuse him so
like the dickens when he never done &ndash; that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear &#8217;em say he&#8217;s the bloodiest
looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn&#8217;t ever hung
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I&#8217;ve heard &#8217;em say
that if he was to get free they&#8217;d lynch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&#8217;d do it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the twilight
drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little
isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that
might clear away their difficulties. But nothing happened; there seemed to be no
angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.</p>

<p>The boys did as they had often done before &ndash; went to the cell grating
and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and there
were no guards.</p>

<p class="hide">VISITING THE PRISONER.</p>
</div>

<p>His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before
&ndash; it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous
to the last degree when Potter said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve been mighty good to me, boys &ndash; better&#8217;n
anybody else in this town. And I don&#8217;t forget it, I don&#8217;t. Often I
says to myself, says I, &lsquo;I used to mend all the boys&#8217; kites and
things, and show &#8217;em where the good fishin&#8217; places was, and befriend
&#8217;em what I could, and now they&#8217;ve all forgot old Muff when
he&#8217;s in trouble; but Tom don&#8217;t, and Huck don&#8217;t &ndash;
<em>they</em> don&#8217;t forget him,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I don&#8217;t
forget them.&rsquo; Well, boys, I done an awful thing &ndash; drunk and crazy at
the time &ndash; that&#8217;s the only way I account for it &ndash; and now I
got to swing for it, and it&#8217;s right. Right, and <em>best</em>, too, I
reckon &ndash; hope so, anyway. Well, we won&#8217;t talk about that. I
don&#8217;t want to make <em>you</em> feel bad; you&#8217;ve befriended me. But
what I want to say, is, don&#8217;t <em>you</em> ever get drunk &ndash; then you
won&#8217;t ever get here. Stand a litter furder west &ndash; so &ndash;
that&#8217;s it; it&#8217;s a prime comfort to see faces that&#8217;s friendly
when a body&#8217;s in such a muck of trouble, and there don&#8217;t none come
here but yourn. Good friendly faces &ndash; good friendly faces. Git up on one
another&#8217;s backs and let me touch &#8217;em. That&#8217;s it. Shake hands
&ndash; yourn&#8217;ll come through the bars, but mine&#8217;s too big. Little
hands, and weak &ndash; but they&#8217;ve helped Muff Potter a power, and
they&#8217;d help him more if they could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors. The
next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room, drawn by an almost
irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having
the same experience. They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away,
from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back
presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room,
but invariably heard distressing news &ndash; the toils were closing more and
more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the village
talk was to the effect that Injun Joe&#8217;s evidence stood firm and unshaken,
and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury&#8217;s
verdict would be.</p>

<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was in a
tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the
village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for this was to be the
great day. Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience.
After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward,
Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon
him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less
conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the
judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual
whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was
as impressive as it was fascinating.</p>

<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in
the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered, and
that he immediately sneaked away. After some further questioning, counsel for
the prosecution said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his
own counsel said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no questions to ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse. Counsel for
the prosecution said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no questions to ask him,&rdquo; Potter&#8217;s lawyer
replied.</p>

<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter&#8217;s
possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience began
to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his client&#8217;s
life without an effort?</p>

<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter&#8217;s guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand without
being cross-questioned.</p>

<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard
upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by
credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Potter&#8217;s
lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in
murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy
prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and rocked
his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the court-room.
Many men were moved, and many women&#8217;s compassion testified itself in
tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while
under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We
have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.&rdquo; [Then to the clerk:]
&ldquo;Call Thomas Sawyer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
Potter&#8217;s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he
rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough, for he was
badly scared. The oath was administered.</p>

<p>TOM SWEARS.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
hour of midnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe&#8217;s iron face and his tongue failed him. The
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to put
enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the graveyard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little bit louder, please. Don&#8217;t be afraid. You
were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the graveyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you anywhere near Horse Williams&#8217;s grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak up &ndash; just a trifle louder. How near were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near as I am to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you hidden, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was hid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behind the elms that&#8217;s on the edge of the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I went there with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait &ndash; wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your
companion&#8217;s name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry
anything there with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak out, my boy &ndash; don&#8217;t be diffident. The truth is
always respectable. What did you take there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a &ndash; a &ndash; dead cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred &ndash; tell it in your own way &ndash; don&#8217;t
skip anything, and don&#8217;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom began &ndash; hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his
own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath
the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly
fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when
the boy said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter
fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his way
through all opposers, and was gone!</p>
