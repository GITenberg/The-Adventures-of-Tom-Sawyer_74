<p><span class="first-word">When</span> Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered
where he was. He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he
comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of
repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf
stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature&#8217;s meditation. Beaded
dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the
fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
still slept.</p>

<p>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the
hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning
whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The
marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the
musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting
two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and &ldquo;sniffing
around,&rdquo; then proceeding again &ndash; for he was measuring, Tom said; and
when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone,
with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward
him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful
moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon
Tom&#8217;s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad &ndash;
for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes &ndash; without
the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants
appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and
lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy
height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said,
&ldquo;Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
children&#8217;s alone,&rdquo; and she took wing and went off to see about it
&ndash; which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more
than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched
the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead.
The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit
in a tree over Tom&#8217;s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors
in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame,
and stopped on a twig almost within the boy&#8217;s reach, cocked his head to
one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and
a big fellow of the &ldquo;fox&rdquo; kind came skurrying along, sitting up at
intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably
never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced
down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came
fluttering upon the scene.</p>

<p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout,
and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each
other in the shallow limpid water of the white sand-bar. They felt no longing
for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of
water. A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their
raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning
the bridge between them and civilization.</p>

<p>THE PIRATES&#8217; BATH.</p>
</div>

<p>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and
they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of clear cold
water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt
that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough
substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck
asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the
river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had
not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome
bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish &ndash; provisions enough for
quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no
fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a
fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they
reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise,
bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.</p>

<p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and
then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gayly
along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of
the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of
grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and
jeweled with flowers.</p>

<div id="ill-69" class="illustration">

<p>THE PLEASANT STROLL.</p>
</div>

<p>They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a
quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated
from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim
about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got
back to camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously
upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk
soon began to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in
the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the
boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
took dim shape, presently &ndash; it was budding home-sickness. Even Finn the
Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they were all
ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought.</p>

<p>For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in
the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes
no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and
forced a recognition. The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each
assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and unbroken;
then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Tom in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t thunder,&rdquo; said Huckleberry, in an awed tone,
&ldquo;becuz thunder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Listen &ndash; don&#8217;t
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little steam
ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current. Her
broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing
about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferry-boat, but the
boys could not determine what the men in them were doing. Presently a great jet
of white smoke burst from the ferry-boat&#8217;s side, and as it expanded and
rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners
again.</p>

<p>THE SEARCH FOR THE DROWNED.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I know now!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom; &ldquo;somebody&#8217;s
drownded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it!&rdquo; said Huck; &ldquo;they done that last summer,
when Bill Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that
makes him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in &#8217;em and set &#8217;em afloat, and wherever there&#8217;s
anybody that&#8217;s drownded, they&#8217;ll float right there and
stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard about that,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I wonder
what makes the bread do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&#8217;t the bread, so much,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;I
reckon it&#8217;s mostly what they <em>say</em> over it before they start it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they don&#8217;t say anything over it,&rdquo; said Huck.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em and they don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&#8217;s funny,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But maybe they say
it to themselves. Of <em>course</em> they do. Anybody might know
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an
ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to
act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By jings, I wish I was over there, now,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do too&rdquo; said Huck &ldquo;I&#8217;d give heaps to know who it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought flashed
through Tom&#8217;s mind, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, I know who&#8217;s drownded &ndash; it&#8217;s us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were
missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were
being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising
up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the
departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far
as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to
be a pirate, after all.</p>

<p>As twilight drew on, the ferry-boat went back to her accustomed business and
the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were jubilant with
vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making.
They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what
the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of
the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon &ndash; from
their point of view. But when the shadows of night closed them in, they
gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds
evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe
could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying
this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and
unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout &ldquo;feeler&rdquo; as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization &ndash; not right now, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in
with Tom, and the waverer quickly &ldquo;explained,&rdquo; and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging
to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the
moment.</p>

<p>As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe
followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time, watching the
two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees, and went searching
among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire. He picked
up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a
sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the
fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his &ldquo;red
keel&rdquo;; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put
in Joe&#8217;s hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner. And he
also put into the hat certain school-boy treasures of almost inestimable value
&ndash; among them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and
one of that kind of marbles known as a &ldquo;sure &#8217;nough crystal.&rdquo;
Then he tip-toed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out
of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the
sand-bar.</p>
