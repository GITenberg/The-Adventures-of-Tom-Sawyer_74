<p><span class="first-word">The</span> reader may rest satisfied that
Tom&#8217;s and Huck&#8217;s windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little
village of St. Petersburg. So vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to
incredible. It was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of
many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.
Every &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages
was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for
hidden treasure &ndash; and not by boys, but men &ndash; pretty grave,
unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were
courted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their
remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable; they
had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover,
their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous
originality. The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys.</p>

<p>The Widow Douglas put Huck&#8217;s money out at six per cent., and Judge
Thatcher did the same with Tom&#8217;s at Aunt Polly&#8217;s request. Each lad
had an income, now, that was simply prodigious &ndash; a dollar for every
weekday in the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got
&ndash; no, it was what he was promised &ndash; he generally couldn&#8217;t
collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy
in those old simple days &ndash; and clothe him and wash him, too, for that
matter.</p>

<p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When Becky
told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at school,
the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which
Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the
Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous
lie &ndash; a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through
history breast to breast with George Washington&#8217;s lauded Truth about the
hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when
he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight off
and told Tom about it.</p>

<p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day.
He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National
Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in
order that he might be ready for either career or both.</p>

<p>Huck Finn&#8217;s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow
Douglas&#8217;s protection introduced him into society &ndash; no, dragged him
into it, hurled him into it &ndash; and his sufferings were almost more than he
could bear. The widow&#8217;s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and
brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one
little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He
had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had
to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that
speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and
shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.</p>

<p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing.
For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress. The
public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged the
river for his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among
some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one
of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon
some stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his
pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had
made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him out,
told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home. Huck&#8217;s
face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t talk about it, Tom. I&#8217;ve tried it, and it
don&#8217;t work; it don&#8217;t work, Tom. It ain&#8217;t for me; I ain&#8217;t
used to it. The widder&#8217;s good to me, and friendly; but I can&#8217;t stand
them ways. She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me
wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won&#8217;t let me sleep in the
wood-shed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they
don&#8217;t seem to any air git through &#8217;em, somehow; and they&#8217;re so
rotten nice that I can&#8217;t set down, nor lay down, nor roll around
anywher&#8217;s; I hain&#8217;t slid on a cellar-door for &ndash; well, it
&#8217;pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat &ndash; I
hate them ornery sermons! I can&#8217;t ketch a fly in there, I can&#8217;t
chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed
by a bell; she gits up by a bell &ndash; everything&#8217;s so awful
reg&#8217;lar a body can&#8217;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-160" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-160.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>COMFORTABLE ONCE MORE.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, everybody does that way, Huck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, it don&#8217;t make no difference. I ain&#8217;t everybody, and I
can&#8217;t <em>stand</em> it. It&#8217;s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes
too easy &ndash; I don&#8217;t take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to
ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming &ndash; dern&#8217;d if I
hain&#8217;t got to ask to do everything. Well, I&#8217;d got to talk so nice it
wasn&#8217;t no comfort &ndash; I&#8217;d got to go up in the attic and rip out
a while, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I&#8217;d a died, Tom. The
widder wouldn&#8217;t let me smoke; she wouldn&#8217;t let me yell, she
wouldn&#8217;t let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks&mdash;&rdquo;
[Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury] &ndash; &ldquo;And dad
fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a woman! I <em>had</em> to
shove, Tom &ndash; I just had to. And besides, that school&#8217;s going to
open, and I&#8217;d a had to go to it &ndash; well, I wouldn&#8217;t stand
<em>that</em>, Tom. Lookyhere, Tom, being rich ain&#8217;t what it&#8217;s
cracked up to be. It&#8217;s just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and
a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this
bar&#8217;l suits me, and I ain&#8217;t ever going to shake &#8217;em any more.
Tom, I wouldn&#8217;t ever got into all this trouble if it hadn&#8217;t a ben
for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along with your&#8217;n, and
gimme a ten-center sometimes &ndash; not many times, becuz I don&#8217;t give a
dern for a thing &#8217;thout it&#8217;s tollable hard to git &ndash; and you go
and beg off for me with the widder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Huck, you know I can&#8217;t do that. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t fair;
and besides if you&#8217;ll try this thing just a while longer you&#8217;ll come
to like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like it! Yes &ndash; the way I&#8217;d like a hot stove if I was to
set on it long enough. No, Tom, I won&#8217;t be rich, and I won&#8217;t live in
them cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
I&#8217;ll stick to &#8217;em, too. Blame it all! just as we&#8217;d got guns,
and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to
come up and spile it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom saw his opportunity&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain&#8217;t going to keep me back from
turning robber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as dead earnest as I&#8217;m sitting here. But Huck, we
can&#8217;t let you into the gang if you ain&#8217;t respectable, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck&#8217;s joy was quenched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t let me in, Tom? Didn&#8217;t you let me go for a
pirate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that&#8217;s different. A robber is more high-toned than what
a pirate is &ndash; as a general thing. In most countries they&#8217;re awful
high up in the nobility &ndash; dukes and such.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-161" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-161.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>HIGH UP IN SOCIETY.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, hain&#8217;t you always ben friendly to me? You
wouldn&#8217;t shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn&#8217;t do that, now,
<em>would</em> you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huck, I wouldn&#8217;t want to, and I <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to
&ndash; but what would people say? Why, they&#8217;d say, &lsquo;Mph! Tom
Sawyer&#8217;s Gang! pretty low characters in it!&rsquo; They&#8217;d mean you,
Huck. You wouldn&#8217;t like that, and I wouldn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and
see if I can come to stand it, if you&#8217;ll let me b&#8217;long to the gang,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Huck, it&#8217;s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and
I&#8217;ll ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you, Tom &ndash; now will you? That&#8217;s good. If she&#8217;ll
let up on some of the roughest things, I&#8217;ll smoke private and cuss
private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn
robbers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, right off. We&#8217;ll get the boys together and have the
initiation to-night, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the which?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the initiation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the
gang&#8217;s secrets, even if you&#8217;re chopped all to flinders, and kill
anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s gay &ndash; that&#8217;s mighty gay, Tom, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing&#8217;s got to be done at
midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find &ndash; a ha&#8217;nted
house is the best, but they&#8217;re all ripped up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, midnight&#8217;s good, anyway, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so it is. And you&#8217;ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it
with blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that&#8217;s something <em>like</em>! Why, it&#8217;s a million
times bullier than pirating. I&#8217;ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and
if I git to be a reg&#8217;lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking
&#8217;bout it, I reckon she&#8217;ll be proud she snaked me in out of the
wet.&rdquo;</p>
