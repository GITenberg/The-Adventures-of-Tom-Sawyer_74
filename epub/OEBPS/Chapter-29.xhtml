<p><span class="first-word">The</span> first thing Tom heard on Friday morning
was a glad piece of news &ndash; Judge Thatcher&#8217;s family had come back to
town the night before. Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary
importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy&#8217;s
interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing
&ldquo;hi-spy&rdquo; and &ldquo;gully-keeper&rdquo; with a crowd of their
school-mates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory
way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and
long-delayed pic-nic, and she consented. The child&#8217;s delight was
boundless; and Tom&#8217;s not more moderate. The invitations were sent out
before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a
fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. Tom&#8217;s excitement
enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of
hearing Huck&#8217;s &ldquo;maow,&rdquo; and of having his treasure to astonish
Becky and the pic-nickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal
came that night.</p>

<p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o&#8217;clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher&#8217;s, and everything was
ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the pic-nics
with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of
a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or
thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently
the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was
sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last
thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll not get back till late. Perhaps you&#8217;d better stay
all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry landing,
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&#8217;ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don&#8217;t be any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say &ndash; I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll do. &#8217;Stead of
going to Joe Harper&#8217;s we&#8217;ll climb right up the hill and stop at the
Widow Douglas&#8217;s. She&#8217;ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day
&ndash; dead loads of it. And she&#8217;ll be awful glad to have us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will mamma say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;ll she ever know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&#8217;s wrong &ndash; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But shucks! Your mother won&#8217;t know, and so what&#8217;s the
harm? All she wants is that you&#8217;ll be safe; and I bet you she&#8217;d a
said go there if she&#8217;d a thought of it. I know she would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Widow Douglas&#8217;s splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
Tom&#8217;s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
nothing anybody about the night&#8217;s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom
that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took
a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give
up the fun at Widow Douglas&#8217;s. And why should he give it up, he reasoned
&ndash; the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more
likely to come to-night? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain
treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and
not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.</p>

<p>Three miles below town the ferry-boat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow
and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy
heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways
of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by and by the rovers
straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the
destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing
season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By and by somebody
shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s ready for the cave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a
general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside &ndash;
an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within
was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and walled by Nature with solid
limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to
stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the
sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping
began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the
owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon
knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
new chase. But all things have an end. By and by the procession went filing down
the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly
revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet
overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few
steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand
&ndash; for McDougal&#8217;s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles
that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one
might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and
chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down,
and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same &ndash; labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man &ldquo;knew&rdquo; the cave. That
was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was
not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much
of the cave as any one.</p>

<div id="ill-128" class="illustration">

<p class="hide">INSIDE THE CAVE.</p>
</div>

<p>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and
then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the
dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors
joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an
hour without going beyond the &ldquo;known&rdquo; ground.</p>

<p>By and by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the
cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings,
daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. Then they
were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night
was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However,
this sort of close to the day&#8217;s adventures was romantic and therefore
satisfactory. When the ferry-boat with her wild freight pushed into the stream,
nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.</p>

<p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferry-boat&#8217;s lights went
glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people were
as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He
wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf &ndash; and
then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business. The
night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o&#8217;clock came, and the noise of
vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling
foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left
the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o&#8217;clock
came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited
what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening.
Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?</p>

<p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley door
closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two
men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be
that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would
be absurd &ndash; the men would get away with the box and never be found again.
No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness
for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and
glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep
just far enough ahead not to be invisible.</p>

<div id="ill-129" class="illustration">

<p>HUCK ON DUTY.</p>
</div>

<p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a
cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that
led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman&#8217;s
house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good,
thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the
quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between
the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and
shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted
along a while; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he
seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the
hill &ndash; ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He
was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four
feet from him! Huck&#8217;s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it
again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of
him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He
knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into
Widow Douglas&#8217;s grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it
won&#8217;t be hard to find.</p>

<p>Now there was a voice &ndash; a very low voice &ndash; Injun Joe&#8217;s:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn her, maybe she&#8217;s got company &ndash; there&#8217;s lights,
late as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t see any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was that stranger&#8217;s voice &ndash; the stranger of the haunted
house. A deadly chill went to Huck&#8217;s heart &ndash; this, then, was the
&ldquo;revenge&rdquo; job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the
Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were
going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he
didn&#8217;t dare &ndash; they might come and catch him. He thought all this and
more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger&#8217;s remark and Injun
Joe&#8217;s next &ndash; which was&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the bush is in your way. Now &ndash; this way &ndash; now you
see, don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, there <em>is</em> company there, I reckon. Better give it
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I&#8217;ve told you
before, I don&#8217;t care for her swag &ndash; you may have it. But her husband
was rough on me &ndash; many times he was rough on me &ndash; and mainly he was
the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain&#8217;t all.
It ain&#8217;t a millionth part of it! He had me <em>horsewhipped</em>! &ndash;
horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger! &ndash; with all the town
looking on! <span class="caps">Horsewhipped!</span> &ndash; do you understand?
He took advantage of me and died. But I&#8217;ll take it out of
<em>her</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t kill her! Don&#8217;t do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill <em>him</em> if he
was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don&#8217;t
kill her &ndash; bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils &ndash; you
notch her ears like a sow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By God, that&#8217;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I&#8217;ll
tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I&#8217;ll not
cry, if she does. My friend, you&#8217;ll help me in this thing &ndash; for
<em>my</em> sake &ndash; that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here &ndash; I
mightn&#8217;t be able alone. If you flinch, I&#8217;ll kill you. Do you
understand that? And if I have to kill you, I&#8217;ll kill her &ndash; and then
I reckon nobody&#8217;ll ever know much about who done this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&#8217;s got to be done, let&#8217;s get at it. The quicker
the better &ndash; I&#8217;m all in a shiver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it <em>now</em>? And company there? Look here &ndash; I&#8217;ll
get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No &ndash; we&#8217;ll wait till
the lights are out &ndash; there&#8217;s no hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue &ndash; a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly
back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a
precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the
other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks;
then another and another, and &ndash; a twig snapped under his foot! His breath
stopped and he listened. There was no sound &ndash; the stillness was perfect.
His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of
sumach bushes &ndash; turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship &ndash;
and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he
felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped,
till he reached the Welshman&#8217;s. He banged at the door, and presently the
heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.</p>

<p>A ROUSING ACT.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the row there? Who&#8217;s banging? What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me in &ndash; quick! I&#8217;ll tell everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huckleberry Finn &ndash; quick, let me in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain&#8217;t a name to open many doors, I
judge! But let him in, lads, and let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&#8217;t ever tell <em>I</em> told you,&rdquo; were
Huck&#8217;s first words when he got in. &ldquo;Please don&#8217;t &ndash;
I&#8217;d be killed, sure &ndash; but the widow&#8217;s been good friends to me
sometimes, and I want to tell &ndash; I <em>will</em> tell if you&#8217;ll
promise you won&#8217;t ever say it was me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, he <em>has</em> got something to tell, or he wouldn&#8217;t
act so!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;out with it and nobody
here&#8217;ll ever tell, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill,
and just entering the sumach path on tip-toe, their weapons in their hands. Huck
accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to
listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there
was an explosion of firearms and a cry.</p>

<p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>
