<p><span class="first-word">Tom</span> arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the
first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to
an unpromising market:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, I&#8217;ve a notion to skin you alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie, what have I done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like
an old softy, expecting I&#8217;m going to make her believe all that rubbage
about that dream, when lo and behold you she&#8217;d found out from Joe that you
was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don&#8217;t know
what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to
think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and
never say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed
to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby
now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie, I wish I hadn&#8217;t done it &ndash; but I didn&#8217;t
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own
selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson&#8217;s
Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me
with a lie about a dream; but you couldn&#8217;t ever think to pity us and save
us from sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn&#8217;t mean to be mean. I
didn&#8217;t, honest. And besides, I didn&#8217;t come over here to laugh at you
that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you come for, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn&#8217;t
got drownded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did
&ndash; and <em>I</em> know it, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed and &#8217;deed I did, auntie &ndash; I wish I may never stir
if I didn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, don&#8217;t lie &ndash; don&#8217;t do it. It only makes
things a hundred times worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&#8217;t a lie, auntie; it&#8217;s the truth. I wanted to keep
you from grieving &ndash; that was all that made me come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d give the whole world to believe that &ndash; it would cover
up a power of sins, Tom. I&#8217;d &#8217;most be glad you&#8217;d run off and
acted so bad. But it ain&#8217;t reasonable; because, why didn&#8217;t you tell
me, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got
all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I
couldn&#8217;t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my
pocket and kept mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What bark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bark I had wrote on to tell you we&#8217;d gone pirating. I wish,
now, you&#8217;d waked up when I kissed you &ndash; I do, honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard lines in his aunt&#8217;s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness
dawned in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Did</em> you kiss me, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you did, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did, auntie &ndash; certain sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you kiss me for, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her
voice when she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss me again, Tom! &ndash; and be off with you to school, now, and
don&#8217;t bother me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket
which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said
to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he&#8217;s lied about it
&ndash; but it&#8217;s a blessed, blessed lie, there&#8217;s such a comfort come
from it. I hope the Lord &ndash; I <em>know</em> the Lord will forgive him,
because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don&#8217;t want
to find out it&#8217;s a lie. I won&#8217;t look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her
hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured,
and this time she fortified herself with the thought: &ldquo;It&#8217;s a good
lie &ndash; it&#8217;s a good lie &ndash; I won&#8217;t let it grieve me.&rdquo;
So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom&#8217;s
piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: &ldquo;I could forgive the boy,
now, if he&#8217;d committed a million sins!&rdquo;</p>
