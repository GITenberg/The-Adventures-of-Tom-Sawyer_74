<p><span class="first-word">Monday</span> morning found Tom Sawyer miserable.
Monday morning always found him so &ndash; because it began another week&#8217;s
slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no
intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much
more odious.</p>

<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick;
then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed
his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he
thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with
considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He
reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front
teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a
&ldquo;starter,&rdquo; as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came
into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt.
So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek
further. Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three
weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore
toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know
the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he
fell to groaning with considerable spirit.</p>

<p>But Sid slept on unconscious.</p>

<p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.</p>

<p>No result from Sid.</p>

<p>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.</p>

<p>Sid snored on.</p>

<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, &ldquo;Sid, Sid!&rdquo; and shook him. This
course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom
went on groaning. Sid said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom! Say, Tom!&rdquo; [No response.] &ldquo;Here, Tom! <em>Tom!</em>
What is the matter, Tom?&rdquo; And he shook him and looked in his face
anxiously.</p>

<p>Tom moaned out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t, Sid. Don&#8217;t joggle me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No &ndash; never mind. It&#8217;ll be over by and by, maybe.
Don&#8217;t call anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must! <em>Don&#8217;t</em> groan so, Tom, it&#8217;s awful. How
long you been this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hours. Ouch! Oh, don&#8217;t stir so, Sid, you&#8217;ll kill
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, why didn&#8217;t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom,
<em>don&#8217;t</em>! It makes my flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you&#8217;ve ever
done to me. When I&#8217;m gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, you ain&#8217;t dying, are you? Don&#8217;t, Tom &ndash; oh,
don&#8217;t. Maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell &#8217;em so, Sid. And Sid,
you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that&#8217;s
come to town, and tell her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now,
so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite
a genuine tone.</p>

<p>Sid flew down-stairs and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom&#8217;s dying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8217;m. Don&#8217;t wait &ndash; come quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbage! I don&#8217;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her
face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bedside she
gasped out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Tom! Tom, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie, I&#8217;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter with you &ndash; what <em>is</em> the matter
with you, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie, my sore toe&#8217;s mortified!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little
foolish, and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Polly, it <em>seemed</em> mortified, and it hurt so I never
minded my tooth at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your tooth, indeed! What&#8217;s the matter with your
tooth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them&#8217;s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, now, don&#8217;t begin that groaning again. Open your
mouth. Well &ndash; your tooth <em>is</em> loose, but you&#8217;re not going to
die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, auntie, don&#8217;t pull it out. It don&#8217;t hurt any
more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don&#8217;t, auntie. <em>I</em>
don&#8217;t want to stay home from school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t you? So all this row was because you
thought you&#8217;d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I
love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with
your outrageousness.&rdquo; By this time the dental instruments were ready. The
old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom&#8217;s tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy&#8217;s face. The tooth hung dangling by
the bedpost, now.</p>

<div id="ill-34" class="illustration">

<p>DENTISTRY.</p>
</div>

<p>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row
of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered
quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his
finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now
found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart
was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn&#8217;t
anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, &ldquo;Sour
grapes!&rdquo; and he wandered away a dismantled hero.</p>

<p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn,
son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the
mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad &ndash;
and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden
society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the
respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and
was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time
he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of
full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His
hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when
he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the
back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged
low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled
up.</p>

<div id="ill-35" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-035.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>HUCKLEBERRY FINN.</p>
</div>

<p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in
fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or
to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or
swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody
forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the
first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the
fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear
wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had.
So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Huckleberry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself, and see how you like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that you got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemme see him, Huck. My, he&#8217;s pretty stiff. Where&#8217;d you
get him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bought him off&#8217;n a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the
slaughter-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;d you get the blue ticket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bought it off&#8217;n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a
hoop-stick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say &ndash; what is dead cats good for, Huck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for? Cure warts with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Is that so? I know something that&#8217;s better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you don&#8217;t. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, spunk-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spunk-water! I wouldn&#8217;t give a dern for spunk-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t you? D&#8217;you ever try
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I hain&#8217;t. But Bob Tanner did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger
told me. There now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it? They&#8217;ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger.
I don&#8217;t know <em>him</em>. But I never see a nigger that
<em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it,
Huck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
rain-water was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the daytime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With his face to the stump?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Least I reckon so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he <em>say</em> anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t reckon he did. I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame
fool way as that! Why, that ain&#8217;t a-going to do any good. You got to go
all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there&#8217;s a
spunk-water stump, and just as it&#8217;s midnight you back up against the stump
and jam your hand in and say:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div>&lsquo;Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,</div>
  <div>Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut,
and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
Because if you speak the charm&#8217;s busted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain&#8217;t the way Bob
Tanner done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, you can bet he didn&#8217;t, becuz he&#8217;s the wartiest
boy in this town; and he wouldn&#8217;t have a wart on him if he&#8217;d knowed
how to work spunk-water. I&#8217;ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands
that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I&#8217;ve always got
considerable many warts. Sometimes I take &#8217;em off with a bean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, bean&#8217;s good. I&#8217;ve done that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you? What&#8217;s your way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and
bury it &#8217;bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then
you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that&#8217;s got the blood
on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and
so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s it, Huck &ndash; that&#8217;s it; though when
you&#8217;re burying it if you say &lsquo;Down bean; off wart; come no more to
bother me!&rsquo; it&#8217;s better. That&#8217;s the way Joe Harper does, and
he&#8217;s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say &ndash; how do
you cure &#8217;em with dead cats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard &#8217;long
about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when
it&#8217;s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you
can&#8217;t see &#8217;em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe
hear &#8217;em talk; and when they&#8217;re taking that feller away, you heave
your cat after &#8217;em and say, &lsquo;Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil,
warts follow cat, <em>I</em>&#8217;m done with ye!&rsquo; That&#8217;ll fetch
<em>any</em> wart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds right. D&#8217;you ever try it, Huck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it&#8217;s so, then. Becuz they say she&#8217;s a
witch.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-36" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-036.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>MOTHER HOPKINS.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Say! Why, Tom, I <em>know</em> she is. She witched pap. Pap says so
his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
took up a rock, and if she hadn&#8217;t dodged, he&#8217;d a got her. Well, that
very night he rolled off&#8217;n a shed wher&#8217; he was a-layin&#8217; drunk,
and broke his arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&#8217;s awful. How did he know she was a-witching
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy, they&#8217;re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they
mumble they&#8217;re saying the Lord&#8217;s Prayer backards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night. I reckon they&#8217;ll come after old Hoss Williams
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they buried him Saturday. Didn&#8217;t they get him Saturday
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight? &ndash;
and <em>then</em> it&#8217;s Sunday. Devils don&#8217;t slosh around much of a
Sunday, I don&#8217;t reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. That&#8217;s so. Lemme go with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course &ndash; if you ain&#8217;t afeard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afeard! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t likely. Will you meow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes &ndash; and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you
kep&#8217; me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and
says &lsquo;Dern that cat!&rsquo; and so I hove a brick through his window
&ndash; but don&#8217;t you tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t meow that night, becuz auntie was
watching me, but I&#8217;ll meow this time. Say &ndash; what&#8217;s
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a tick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;d you get him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;ll you take for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to sell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. It&#8217;s a mighty small tick, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don&#8217;t belong to them.
I&#8217;m satisfied with it. It&#8217;s a good enough tick for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho, there&#8217;s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of
&#8217;em if I wanted to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&#8217;t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can&#8217;t.
This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It&#8217;s the first one I&#8217;ve seen
this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Huck &ndash; I&#8217;ll give you my tooth for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it
wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it genuwyne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; said Huckleberry, &ldquo;it&#8217;s a
trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
pinch-bug&#8217;s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
before.</p>

<p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung his
hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity. The
master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled
by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Sawyer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow
hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love;
and by that form was <em>the only vacant place</em> on the girls&#8217; side of
the school-house. He instantly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="caps">I stopped to talk with Huckleberry
Finn!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The
master said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You &ndash; you did what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
jacket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished. Then the order followed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, go and sit with the <em>girls</em>! And let this be a
warning to you.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-37" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-037.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>RESULT OF TOM&#8217;S TRUTHFULNESS.</p>
</div>

<p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in
reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown
idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon
the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss
of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat
still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his
book.</p>

<p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose
upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at
the girl. She observed it, &ldquo;made a mouth&rdquo; at him and gave him the
back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around
again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She
thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its
place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, &ldquo;Please take it
&ndash; I got more.&rdquo; The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now
the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left
hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently
began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see,
but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and
hesitatingly whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it
and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl&#8217;s
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else.
When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s nice &ndash; make a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was
satisfied with the monster, and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a beautiful man &ndash; now make me coming
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the
spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s ever so nice &ndash; I wish I could draw.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="ill-38" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-038.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>TOM AS AN ARTIST.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s easy,&rdquo; whispered Tom, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll learn
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you? When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At noon. Do you go home to dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll stay if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good &ndash; that&#8217;s a whack. What&#8217;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becky Thatcher. What&#8217;s yours? Oh, I know. It&#8217;s Thomas
Sawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the name they lick me by. I&#8217;m Tom when I&#8217;m
good. You call me Tom, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the
girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&#8217;t anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No it ain&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t want to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No I won&#8217;t &ndash; deed and deed and double deed
won&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&#8217;t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you
live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&#8217;t ever tell <em>any</em>body. Now let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>you</em> don&#8217;t want to see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that you treat me so, I <em>will</em> see.&rdquo; And she put her
small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed:
&ldquo;<em>I love you.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you bad thing!&rdquo; And she hit his hand a smart rap, but
reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear,
and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the house and
deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole
school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally

turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class

pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.</p>
