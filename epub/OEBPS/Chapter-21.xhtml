<p><span class="first-word">Vacation</span> was approaching. The schoolmaster,
always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the
school to make a good showing on &ldquo;Examination&rdquo; day. His rod and his
ferule were seldom idle now &ndash; at least among the smaller pupils. Only the
biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr.
Dobbins&#8217;s lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried,
under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age,
and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,
all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was,
that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights
in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief.
But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful
success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field
badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised
a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter&#8217;s boy, told him the
scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the
master boarded in his father&#8217;s family and had given the boy ample cause to
hate him. The master&#8217;s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few
days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always
prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the
sign-painter&#8217;s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper
condition on Examination Evening he would &ldquo;manage the thing&rdquo; while
he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and
hurried away to school.</p>

<p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the
evening the school-house was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and
festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon
a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably
mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were
occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. To his
left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which
were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening;
rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and
muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers&#8217;
ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their
hair. All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.</p>

<div id="ill-96" class="illustration">

<p>EXAMINATION EVENING.</p>
</div>

<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
&ldquo;You&#8217;d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the
stage,&rdquo; etc. &ndash; accompanying himself with the painfully exact and
spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used &ndash; supposing the machine
to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.</p>

<p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, &ldquo;Mary had a little lamb,&rdquo; etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down
flushed and happy.</p>

<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the
unquenchable and indestructible &ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death&rdquo;
speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle
of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was
like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the
house&#8217;s silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master
frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled a while and then
retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died
early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck&rdquo; followed; also &ldquo;The
Assyrian Came Down,&rdquo; and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading
exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
prime feature of the evening was in order, now &ndash; original
&ldquo;compositions&rdquo; by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward
to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied
with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to
&ldquo;expression&rdquo; and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been
illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their
grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to
the Crusades. &ldquo;Friendship&rdquo; was one; &ldquo;Memories of Other
Days&rdquo;; &ldquo;Religion in History&rdquo;; &ldquo;Dream Land&rdquo;;
&ldquo;The Advantages of Culture&rdquo;; &ldquo;Forms of Political Government
Compared and Contrasted&rdquo;; &ldquo;Melancholy&rdquo;; &ldquo;Filial
Love&rdquo;; &ldquo;Heart Longings,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>

<div id="ill-97" class="illustration">
<img src="images/Illustration-097.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>ON EXHIBITION.</p>
</div>

<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy;
another was a wasteful and opulent gush of &ldquo;fine language&rdquo;; another
was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until
they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and
marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled
tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might
be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that
the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring
insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the
fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be
sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land
where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a
sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least
religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly
pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.</p>

<p>Let us return to the &ldquo;Examination.&rdquo; The first composition that
was read was one entitled &ldquo;Is this, then, Life?&rdquo; Perhaps the reader
can endure an extract from it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the
youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination
is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary
of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, &lsquo;the observed of all
observers.&rsquo; Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through
the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the
gay assembly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour
arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such
bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision!
Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that
beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her
soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and
with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that
earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time
during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of &ldquo;How
sweet!&rdquo; &ldquo;How eloquent!&rdquo; &ldquo;So true!&rdquo; etc., and after
the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the
&ldquo;interesting&rdquo; paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read
a &ldquo;poem.&rdquo; Two stanzas of it will do:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="title">&ldquo;A MISSOURI MAIDEN&#8217;S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</div>

  <div class="stanza">
  <div>&ldquo;<span class="caps">Alabama</span>, good-bye! I love thee well!</div>
    <div class="indent">But yet for a while do I leave thee now!</div>
  <div>Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,</div>
    <div class="indent">And burning recollections throng my brow!</div>
  <div>For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;</div>
    <div class="indent">Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa&#8217;s stream;</div>
  <div>Have listened to Tallassee&#8217;s warring floods,</div>
    <div class="indent">And wooed on Coosa&#8217;s side Aurora&#8217;s beam.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
  <div>&ldquo;Yet shame I not to bear an o&#8217;erfull heart,</div>
    <div class="indent">Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;</div>
  <div>&#8217;Tis from no stranger land I now must part,</div>
    <div class="indent">&#8217;Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.</div>
  <div>Welcome and home were mine within this State,</div>
    <div class="indent">Whose vales I leave &ndash; whose spires fade fast from me</div>
  <div>And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and <span xml:lang="fr">tête</span>,</div>
    <div class="indent">When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!&rdquo;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There were very few there who knew what &ldquo;<em
xml:lang="fr">tête</em>&rdquo; meant, but the poem was very satisfactory,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who
paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a
measured, solemn tone:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="title">&ldquo;A VISION</div>

<p>&ldquo;Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single
star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated
upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the
cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by
the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from
their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the
wildness of the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit
sighed; but instead thereof,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div>&lsquo;My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide&mdash;</div>
  <div>My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,&rsquo; came to my side.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the
sunny walks of fancy&#8217;s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty
unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it
failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her
genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away
unperceived &ndash; unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like
icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements
without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first
prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the
evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it,
made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most
&ldquo;eloquent&rdquo; thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster
himself might well be proud of it.</p>

<div id="ill-98" class="illustration">

<p>PRIZE AUTHORS.</p>
</div>

<p id="note-3b">It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions
in which the word &ldquo;beauteous&rdquo; was over-fondled, and human experience
referred to as &ldquo;life&#8217;s page,&rdquo; was up to the usual average.<a
class="call" href="Notes.xhtml#note-3">3</a></p>

<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside,
turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the
blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he made a sad business of
it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He
knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and
remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was
more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if
determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened
upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it
even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced
with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,
suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and
jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and
clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The
tittering rose higher and higher &ndash; the cat was within six inches of the
absorbed teacher&#8217;s head &ndash; down, down, a little lower, and she
grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into
the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the
light did blaze abroad from the master&#8217;s bald pate &ndash; for the
sign-painter&#8217;s boy had <em>gilded</em> it!</p>
